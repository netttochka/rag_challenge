      "text": "Item 1.\nBusiness\nOverview\nIncyte is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of\nproprietary therapeutics. Our global headquarters is located in Wilmington, Delaware, where we conduct\nglobal clinical development and commercial operations. We also conduct clinical development and commercial\noperations from our European headquarters in Morges, Switzerland and our other offices across Europe, as\nwell as our Japanese office in Tokyo and our Canadian headquarters in Montreal.\nAs described in more detail below, we operate in two therapeutic areas that are defined by the indications\nof our approved medicines and the diseases for which our clinical candidates are being developed. One\ntherapeutic area is Hematology/Oncology, which comprises Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPNs), Graft-\nVersus-Host Disease (GVHD), and solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. The other therapeutic area is\nInflammation and Autoimmunity (IAI), which includes our Dermatology commercial franchise. We are also\neligible to receive milestones and royalties on molecules discovered by us and licensed to third parties.\nHematology and Oncology\nOur hematology and oncology franchise comprises four approved products, which are JAKAFI\n(ruxolitinib), MONJUVI (tafasitamab-cxix)/MINJUVI (tafasitamab), PEMAZYRE (pemigatinib) and\nICLUSIG (ponatinib), as well as numerous clinical development programs.\nJAKAFI (ruxolitinib)\nJAKAFI (ruxolitinib) is our first product to be approved for sale in the United States. It was approved by\nthe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2011 for the treatment of adults with\nintermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis (MF); in December 2014 for the treatment of adults with polycythemia\nvera (PV) who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant of hydroxyurea; in May 2019 for the\ntreatment of steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in adult and pediatric patients\n12 years and older; and in September 2021 for the treatment of chronic GVHD after failure of one or two lines\nof systemic therapy in adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older. MF and PV are both myeloproliferative\nneoplasms (MPNs), a type of rare blood cancer, and GVHD is an adverse immune response to an allogeneic\nhematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Under our collaboration agreement with our collaboration\npartner Novartis Pharmaceutical International Ltd., Novartis received exclusive development and\ncommercialization rights to ruxolitinib outside of the United States for all hematologic and oncologic\nindications and sells ruxolitinib outside of the United States under the name JAKAVI.\nIn 2003, we initiated a research and development program to explore the inhibition of enzymes called\njanus associated kinases (JAK). The JAK family is composed of four tyrosine kinases — JAK1, JAK2, JAK3\nand Tyk2 — that are involved in the signaling of a number of cytokines and growth factors. JAKs are central\nto a number of biologic processes, including the formation and development of blood cells and the regulation\nof immune functions. Dysregulation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway has been associated with a number\nof diseases, including myeloproliferative neoplasms, other hematological malignancies, rheumatoid arthritis\nand other chronic inflammatory diseases.\nWe have discovered multiple potent, selective and orally bioavailable JAK inhibitors that are selective for\nJAK1 or JAK1 and JAK2. JAKAFI is the most advanced compound in our JAK program. It is an oral JAK1\nand JAK2 inhibitor.\nJAKAFI is marketed in the United States through our own specialty sales force and commercial team.\nJAKAFI was the first FDA-approved JAK inhibitor for any indication, was the first FDA-approved product\nin MF, PV and steroid-refractory acute GVHD, and was recently approved in steroid-refractory chronic\nGVHD. JAKAFI remains the first-line standard of care in MF and remains the only FDA-approved product\nfor steroid-refractory acute GVHD. The FDA has granted JAKAFI orphan drug status for MF, PV and\nGVHD.\nJAKAFI is distributed primarily through a network of specialty pharmacy providers and wholesalers\nthat allow for efficient delivery of the medication by mail directly to patients or direct delivery to the patient’s\n7"

      "text": "pharmacy. Our distribution process uses a model that is well-established and familiar to physicians who\npractice within the oncology field.\nTo further support appropriate use and future development of JAKAFI, our U.S. Medical Affairs\ndepartment is responsible for providing appropriate scientific and medical education and information to\nphysicians, preparing scientific presentations and publications, and overseeing the process for supporting\ninvestigator sponsored trials.\nMyelofibrosis.\nMF is a rare, life-threatening condition. MF, considered the most serious of the\nmyeloproliferative neoplasms, can occur either as primary MF, or as secondary MF that develops in some\npatients who previously had polycythemia vera or essential thrombocythemia. We estimate there are between\n16,000 and 18,500 patients with MF in the United States. Based on the modern prognostic scoring systems\nreferred to as International Prognostic Scoring System and Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System,\nwe believe intermediate and high-risk patients represent 80% to 90% of all patients with MF in the United\nStates and encompass patients over the age of 65, or patients who have or have ever had any of the following:\nanemia, constitutional symptoms, elevated white blood cell or blast counts, or platelet counts less than 100,000\nper microliter of blood.\nMost MF patients have enlarged spleens and many suffer from debilitating symptoms, including\nabdominal discomfort, pruritus (itching), night sweats and cachexia (involuntary weight loss). There were no\nFDA approved therapies for MF until the approval of JAKAFI.\nThe FDA approval was based on results from two randomized Phase III trials (COMFORT-I and\nCOMFORT-II), which demonstrated that patients treated with JAKAFI experienced significant reductions\nin splenomegaly (enlarged spleen). COMFORT-I also demonstrated improvements in symptoms. The most\ncommon hematologic adverse reactions in both trials were thrombocytopenia and anemia. These events rarely\nled to discontinuation of JAKAFI treatment. The most common non-hematologic adverse reactions were\nbruising, dizziness and headache.\nIn August 2014, the FDA approved supplemental labeling for JAKAFI to include Kaplan-Meier overall\nsurvival curves as well as additional safety and dosing information. The overall survival information is based\non three-year data from COMFORT-I and II, and shows that at three years the probability of survival for\npatients treated with JAKAFI in COMFORT-I was 70% and for those patients originally randomized to\nplacebo it was 61%. In COMFORT-II, at three years the probability of survival for patients treated with\nJAKAFI was 79% and for patients originally randomized to best available therapy it was 59%. In\nDecember 2016, we announced an exploratory pooled analysis of data from the five-year follow-up of the\nCOMFORT-I and COMFORT-II trials of patients treated with JAKAFI, which further supported previously\npublished overall survival findings.\nIn September 2016, we announced that JAKAFI had been included as a recommended treatment in the\nlatest National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for\nmyelofibrosis, underscoring the important and long term clinical benefits seen in patients treated with\nJAKAFI.\nIn October 2017, the FDA approved updated labeling for JAKAFI to include the addition of new patient-\nreported outcome (PRO) data from the COMFORT-I study, as well as updating the warning related to\nprogressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. An exploratory analysis of PRO data of patients with\nmyelofibrosis receiving JAKAFI showed improvement in fatigue-related symptoms at Week 24. Fatigue\nresponse (defined as a reduction of 4.5 points or more from baseline in the PROMIS® Fatigue total score) was\nreported in 35% of patients treated with JAKAFI versus 14% of the patients treated with placebo.\nPolycythemia Vera.\nPV is a myeloproliferative neoplasm typically characterized by elevated hematocrit,\nthe volume percentage of red blood cells in whole blood, which can lead to a thickening of the blood and an\nincreased risk of blood clots, as well as an elevated white blood cell and platelet count. When phlebotomy can\nno longer control PV, chemotherapy such as hydroxyurea, or interferon, is utilized. Approximately 25,000\npatients with PV in the United States are considered uncontrolled because they have an inadequate response\nto or are intolerant of hydroxyurea, the most commonly used chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of PV.\n8"

      "text": "In December 2014, the FDA approved JAKAFI for the treatment of patients with PV who have had an\ninadequate response to or are intolerant of hydroxyurea. The approval of JAKAFI for PV was based on data\nfrom the pivotal Phase III RESPONSE trial. In this trial, patients treated with JAKAFI demonstrated superior\nhematocrit control and reductions in spleen volume compared to best available therapy. In addition, a greater\nproportion of patients treated with JAKAFI achieved complete hematologic remission — which was defined\nas achieving hematocrit control, and lowering platelet and white blood cell counts. In the RESPONSE trial,\nthe most common hematologic adverse reactions (incidence > 20%) were thrombocytopenia and anemia. The\nmost common non-hematologic adverse events (incidence >10%) were headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea,\ndizziness, fatigue, pruritus, dyspnea and muscle spasms.\nIn March 2016, the FDA approved supplemental labeling for JAKAFI to include additional safety data\nas well as efficacy analyses from the RESPONSE trial to assess the durability of response in JAKAFI treated\npatients after 80 weeks. At this time, 83% patients were still on treatment, and 76% of the responders\nat 32 weeks maintained their response through 80 weeks.\nIn June 2016, we announced data from the Phase III RESPONSE-2 study of JAKAFI in patients with\ninadequately controlled PV that was resistant to or intolerant of hydroxyurea who did not have an enlarged\nspleen. These data showed that JAKAFI was superior to best available therapy in maintaining hematocrit\ncontrol (62.2% vs. 18.7%, respectively; P<0.0001) without the need for phlebotomy.\nIn August 2017, we announced that JAKAFI had been included as a recommended treatment in the\nlatest NCCN Guidelines for patients with polycythemia vera who have had an inadequate response to first-line\ntherapies, such as hydroxyurea.\nGraft-versus-host disease.\nGVHD is a condition that can occur after an allogeneic HSCT (the transfer\nof genetically dissimilar stem cells or tissue). In GVHD, the donated bone marrow or peripheral blood stem\ncells view the recipient’s body as foreign and attack various tissues. 12-month survival rates in patients with\nGrade III or IV steroid-refractory acute GVHD are 50% or less, and the incidence of steroid-refractory acute\nand chronic GVHD is approximately 3,000 per year in the United States.\nIn June 2016, we announced that the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for ruxolitinib in\npatients with acute GVHD. In May 2019, the FDA approved JAKAFI for the treatment of steroid-refractory\nacute GVHD in adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older. The approval was based on data from\nREACH1, an open-label, single-arm, multicenter study of JAKAFI in combination with corticosteroids in\npatients with steroid-refractory grade II-IV acute GVHD. The overall response rate (ORR) in patients\nrefractory to steroids alone was 57% with a complete response (CR) rate of 31%. The most frequently reported\nadverse reactions among all study participants were infections (55%) and edema (51%), and the most common\nlaboratory abnormalities were anemia (75%), thrombocytopenia (75%) and neutropenia (58%).\nIn September 2021, the FDA approved JAKAFI for the treatment of chronic GVHD after failure of one\nor two lines of systemic therapy in adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older. This approval was based on\ndata from REACH3, a Phase III, randomized, open-label, multicenter study of JAKAFI in comparison to\nbest available therapy for treatment of steroid-refractory chronic GVHD after allogeneic stem cell\ntransplantation. The overall response rate through Cycle 7 Day 1 was 70% for JAKAFI compared to 57% for\nbest available therapy. The most common hematologic adverse reactions (incidence > 35%) were anemia and\nthrombocytopenia. The most common non-hematologic adverse reactions (incidence ≥20%) were infections\n(pathogen not specified) and viral infection. In addition, the FDA updated labeling for JAKAFI to include\nwarnings of increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, thrombosis, and secondary malignancies\nrelated to another JAK-inhibitor treating rheumatoid arthritis, a condition for which JAKAFI is not indicated.\nIn patients with MF and PV treated with JAKAFI in clinical trials, the rates of thromboembolic events were\nsimilar in JAKAFI and control treated patients.\nWe have retained all development and commercialization rights to JAKAFI in the United States and are\neligible to receive development and sales milestones as well as royalties from product sales outside the United\nStates. We hold patents that cover the composition of matter and use of ruxolitinib. These patents, including\napplicable extensions, currently expire in late-2028. We have been granted pediatric exclusivity which adds\nsix months to the expiration for all ruxolitinib patents presently listed in FDA’s Approved Drug Products with\nTherapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (Orange Book).\n9"

Tafasitamab is an Fc-engineered antibody against CD19\ncurrently in clinical development for the treatment of B cell malignancies. We have rights to co-commercialize\ntafasitamab in the United States with MorphoSys, and we have exclusive development and commercialization\nrights outside of the United States.\nIn July 2020, we and MorphoSys announced that the FDA approved MONJUVI (tafasitamab-cxix),\nwhich is indicated in combination with lenalidomide for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or\nrefractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) not otherwise specified, including DLBCL arising from\nlow grade lymphoma, and who are not eligible for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). MONJUVI was\napproved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate from the MorphoSys-sponsored Phase II\nL-MIND study, an open label, multicenter, single arm trial of MONJUVI in combination with lenalidomide\nas a treatment for adult patients with r/r DLBCL. Results from the study showed an objective response rate\n(ORR) of 55% (39 out of 71 patients; primary endpoint) and a complete response (CR) rate of 37% (26 out of\n71 patients). The median duration of response (mDOR) was 21.7 months. The most frequent serious adverse\nreactions were infections (26%), including pneumonia (7%) and febrile neutropenia (6%). Updated three-year\ndata from L-MIND were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2021.\nIn August 2020, we and MorphoSys announced that MONJUVI in combination with lenalidomide had\nbeen included in the latest National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines in\nOncology for B-cell Lymphomas.\nIn August 2021, we and MorphoSys announced that the European Commission (EC) granted conditional\nmarketing authorization for MINJUVI (tafasitamab) in combination with lenalidomide, followed by\nMINJUVI monotherapy, for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL who are not\neligible for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). The conditional approval was based on the three-year\nresults from the L-MIND study evaluating the safety and efficacy of MINJUVI in combination with\nlenalidomide as a treatment for patients with r/r DLBCL who are not eligible for ASCT. The results showed\nbest objective response rate (ORR) of 56.8% (primary endpoint), including a complete response (CR) rate of\n39.5% and a partial response rate (PR) of 17.3%, as assessed by an independent review committee. The median\nduration of response (mDOR) was 43.9 months after a minimum follow up of 35 months (secondary\nendpoint). MINJUVI together with lenalidomide was shown to provide a clinically meaningful response and\nthe side effects were manageable. Warnings and precautions for MINJUVI include infusion-related reactions,\nmyelosuppression, including neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, infections and tumour lysis syndrome.\nDLBCL is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in adults worldwide, comprising 40% of\nall cases. DLBCL is characterized by rapidly growing masses of malignant B-cells in the lymph nodes, spleen,\nliver, bone marrow or other organs. It is an aggressive disease with ~40% of patients not responding to initial\ntherapy or relapsing thereafter. We estimate that there are ~10,000 patients diagnosed in the United States\neach year with r/r DLBCL who are not eligible for ASCT. In the EU, we estimate there are ~14,000 patients\ndiagnosed each year with r/r DLBCL who are not eligible for ASCT.\nPEMAZYRE (pemigatinib)\nPEMAZYRE is the first internally discovered product to be internationally commercialized by us.\nIn April 2020, we announced that the FDA approved PEMAZYRE (pemigatinib), a selective fibroblast\ngrowth factor receptor (FGFR) kinase inhibitor, for the treatment of adults with previously treated,\nunresectable locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with an FGFR2 fusion or other\nrearrangement as detected by an FDA-approved test. PEMAZYRE is the first FDA-approved treatment for\nthis indication, which was approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate and duration of\nresponse (DOR).\n10"

Together, we plan to develop axatilimab as a therapy for patients with chronic GVHD\nas well as in additional immune-mediated diseases where CSF-1R-dependent monocytes and macrophages\nare believed to contribute to organ fibrosis. In December 2021, updated positive data were presented at ASH\nfrom the Phase I/II trial evaluating axatilimab as a monotherapy in patients with recurrent or refractory\nchronic GVHD after two or more prior lines of therapy. A 68% overall response rate and broad clinical benefit\nacross multiple organs were observed at doses being assessed in AGAVE-201, a global pivotal trial evaluating\naxatilimab monotherapy in patients with chronic GVHD in the third line setting. Additional trials of\naxatilimab are planned in patients with chronic GVHD, including a Phase II trial in combination with\nruxolitinib in patients with newly-diagnosed cGVHD.

Parsaclisib is a PI3Kδ inhibitor\nthat has demonstrated potency and selectivity in preclinical studies and has potential therapeutic utility in the\ntreatment of patients with lymphoma. We initiated the CITADEL clinical program to evaluate parsaclisib in\nnon-Hodgkin lymphomas, including Phase II trials in follicular lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma and\nmantle cell lymphoma. The FDA granted orphan drug designation and Fast Track designation to parsaclisib\nas a treatment for patients with follicular lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma.\nIn December 2020, we announced preliminary results from the ongoing CITADEL monotherapy\ndevelopment program, which was designed to enable registration of parsaclisib. Results from four cohorts\nwere presented at the American Society of Hematology (ASH), including in r/r follicular lymphoma\n(CITADEL-203), in BTK-naïve r/r marginal zone lymphoma (CITADEL-204) and in both BTK-naïve and\nBTK-experienced r/r mantle cell lymphoma (CITADEL-205).\nIn October 2021, we announced the FDA acceptance of an NDA seeking approval of parsaclisib for the\ntreatment of patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma and mantle\ncell lymphoma. The submission was based on data from several Phase II studies (CITADEL-203, -204 and\n-205) evaluating parsaclisib as a treatment for relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphomas (follicular,\nmarginal zone and mantle cell). In January 2022, we announced that we withdrew the NDA seeking approval\nof parsaclisib for the three indications in non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The decision to withdraw the NDA\nfollowed discussions with FDA regarding confirmatory studies that we determined cannot be completed\nwithin a reasonable time period to support an accelerated approval. In July 2022, we withdrew the Marketing\nAuthorization Application (MAA) seeking approval of parsaclisib in marginal zone lymphoma following\ndiscussions with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) regarding the confirmatory study needed to support\nthe approval which we determined were not feasible.\nParsaclisib is being evaluated as a treatment for autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), a rare red blood\ncell disorder. In June 2021, data from a Phase II trial were presented at EHA. The majority of patients achieved\na response with parsaclisib over the initial 12-week treatment period and treatment with parsaclisib was\ngenerally well tolerated.

Onset can occur at any age, but is more common in infants and children. In the United States, we\nestimate that there are approximately 10 million diagnosed adolescent and adult patients with AD.\nThe approval of OPZELURA was based on data from two randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled\nPhase III studies (TRuE-AD1 and TRuE-AD 2) evaluating the safety and efficacy of OPZELURA in\nadolescents and adults with mild to moderate AD. Significantly more patients treated with OPZELURA\nachieved Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) Treatment Success at Week 8 (defined as an IGA score of 0\nor 1 with at least a 2-point improvement from baseline, the primary endpoint: 53.8% in TRuE-AD1 and 51.3%\nin TRuE-AD2, compared to vehicle (15.1% in TRuE-AD1, 7.6% in TRuE-AD2; P<0.0001)). Significantly\nmore patients treated with OPZELURA experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in itch from baseline at\nWeek 8, as measured by a ≥4-point reduction in the itch Numerical Rating Scale (itch NRS4): 52.2% in TRuE-\nAD1 and 50.7% in TRuE-AD2, compared to vehicle (15.4% in TRuE-AD1, 16.3% in TRuE-AD2; P<0.0001),\namong patients with an NRS score of at least 4 at baseline. The most common (≥1%) treatment-emergent\nadverse reactions in patients treated with OPZELURA were nasopharyngitis, diarrhea, bronchitis, ear\ninfection, eosinophil count increased, urticaria, folliculitis, tonsillitis and rhinorrhea.\nVitiligo.\nIn July 2022, we announced that the FDA approved OPZELURA for the topical treatment of\nnonsegmental vitiligo in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. OPZELURA was approved for\ncontinuous use and no limits to duration as a treatment for nonsegmental vitiligo.\nVitiligo is a chronic autoimmune depigmenting skin disease characterized by patches of the skin losing\ntheir pigment. It is estimated that there are at least 1.5 million patients diagnosed with vitiligo in the United\nStates, with the majority of patients (approximately 85%) suffering from nonsegmental vitiligo. OPZELURA\nis the first and only FDA approved treatment for repigmentation of vitiligo lesions.\nThe approval of OPZELURA in vitiligo was based on two randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled\nPhase III studies (TRuE-V1 and TRuE-V2) evaluating the safety and efficacy of OPZELURA in adolescents\nand adults with nonsegmental vitiligo. Treatment with 1.5% ruxolitinib cream twice daily (BID) resulted in\ngreater improvement versus vehicle for the primary and all key secondary endpoints in both the TRuE-V1 and\nTRuE-V2 studies. Results, which were consistent across both studies, showed that 29.9% of patients applying\nruxolitinib cream achieved >75% improvement from baseline in the facial Vitiligo Area Scoring Index\n(F-VASI75) at Week 24, the primary endpoint. At Week 52, approximately 50% of patients achieved F-VASI75.\nThe most common (>1%) treatment-emergent adverse reactions in patients treated with OPZELURA were\napplication site acne, application site pruritus, nasopharyngitis, headache, urinary tract infection, application\nsite erythema and pyrexia.\nClinical Programs in Dermatology\nRuxolitinib cream\nRuxolitinib cream is a potent, selective inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2 that provides the opportunity to\ndirectly target diverse pathogenic pathways that underlie certain dermatologic conditions, including atopic\ndermatitis, vitiligo, lichen planus, lichen sclerosus and hidradenitis suppurativa.\nIn October 2021, we announced the validation of the MAA for ruxolitinib cream as a potential treatment\nfor adolescents and adults (age ≥12 years) with nonsegmental vitiligo with facial involvement.\n16"

Lichen planus is a recurrent inflammatory condition affecting the skin and mucosal surfaces\nand can result in itchy, purple bumps on the skin. Lichen sclerosus is a chronic inflammatory skin disease most\ncommonly affecting women and can result in painful ulcers and intense itching. In December 2022, we also\ninitiated a Phase II trial evaluating ruxolitinib cream in mild to moderate hidradenitis suppurativa.\nPovorcitinib\nWe are also developing povorcitinib (formerly INCB54707), which is an oral small molecule selective\nJAK1 inhibitor. Povorcitinib is undergoing evaluation in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), a chronic\nskin condition where lesions develop as a result of inflammation and infection of the sweat glands. In\nOctober 2020, initial results from the clinical program were presented and a randomized Phase IIb trial of\npovorcitinib is underway in patients with HS.\nIn March 2021, we initiated a Phase II trial evaluating povorcitinib in patients with vitiligo. A Phase II\ntrial evaluating povorcitinib in patients with prurigo nodularis is ongoing. In August 2022, we presented results\nfrom the Phase II trial of povorcitinib in HS.

These include\nOLUMIANT (baricitinib), which is licensed to our collaborative partner Eli Lilly and Company, and JAKAVI\n(ruxolitinib) and TABRECTA (capmatinib), which are licensed to Novartis.\nBaricitinib\nWe have a second JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor, baricitinib, which is subject to our collaboration agreement\nwith Lilly, in which Lilly received exclusive worldwide development and commercialization rights to the\ncompound for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.\nRheumatoid Arthritis.\nRheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease characterized by aberrant or\nabnormal immune mechanisms that lead to joint inflammation and swelling and, in some patients, the\nprogressive destruction of joints. Rheumatoid arthritis can also affect connective tissue in the skin and organs\nof the body.\nCurrent rheumatoid arthritis treatments include the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,\ndisease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, such as methotrexate, and the newer biological response modifiers\nthat target pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor, implicated in the pathogenesis of\nrheumatoid arthritis. None of these approaches to treatment is curative; therefore, there remains an unmet\nneed for new safe and effective treatment options for these patients. Rheumatoid arthritis is estimated to affect\nabout 1% of the world’s population.\nThe Phase III program of baricitinib in patients with rheumatoid arthritis incorporated all three\nrheumatoid arthritis populations (methotrexate naïve, biologic naïve, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\ninhibitor inadequate responders); used event rates to fully power the baricitinib program for structural\ncomparison and non-inferiority vs. adalimumab; and evaluated patient-reported outcomes. All four Phase III\ntrials met their respective primary endpoints.\nIn January 2016, Lilly submitted an NDA to the FDA and an MAA to the EMA for baricitinib as\ntreatment for rheumatoid arthritis. In February 2017, we and Lilly announced that the European Commission\napproved baricitinib as OLUMIANT for the treatment of moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis in adult\npatients who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to, one or more disease-modifying\nantirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). In July 2017, the MHLW granted marketing approval for OLUMIANT for\nthe treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (including the prevention of structural injury of joints) in patients with\ninadequate response to standard-of-care therapies. In June 2018, the FDA approved the 2mg dose of\nOLUMIANT for the treatment of adults with moderately-to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who\nhave had an inadequate response to one or more tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor therapies.\nAtopic Dermatitis.\nLilly has conducted a Phase IIa trial and a Phase III program to evaluate the safety\nand efficacy of baricitinib in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. The JAK-STAT pathway has\nbeen shown to play an essential role in the dysregulation of immune responses in atopic dermatitis. Therefore,\nwe believe that inhibiting cytokine pathways dependent on JAK1 and JAK2 may lead to positive clinical\noutcomes in AD.\nIn February 2019, we and Lilly announced that baricitinib met the primary endpoint in BREEZE-AD1\nand BREEZE-AD2, two Phase III studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of baricitinib monotherapy for\nthe treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD and, in August 2019, we and Lilly announced that\nbaricitinib met the primary endpoint in BREEZE-AD7, a Phase III study evaluating the efficacy and safety of\nbaricitinib in combination with standard-of-care topical corticosteroids in patients with moderate-to-severe\nAD. In January 2020, we and Lilly announced that baricitinib met the primary endpoint in both BREEZE-\nAD4 and BREEZE-AD5, the results of which completed the placebo-controlled data program intended to\nsupport global registrations.

In April 2021, we and Lilly announced the\nFDA extended the review period for the sNDA for baricitinib for the treatment of moderate to severe AD by\nthree months to allow time for additional data analyses. In July 2021, we and Lilly announced that the FDA\nwill not meet the PDUFA action date for the sNDA for baricitinib for the treatment of adults with moderate\nto severe AD due to the FDA’s ongoing assessment of JAK inhibitors. In January 2022, Lilly provided a\nregulatory update on the sNDA based on ongoing discussions with the FDA. Lilly announced that alignment\nwith the FDA on the indicated population had not yet been reached and given the FDA’s position, there would\nbe the possibility of a Complete Response Letter (CRL).\nIn January 2020, Lilly announced that baricitinib had been submitted for regulatory review in Europe as\na treatment for patients with moderate-to-severe AD. In October 2020, Lilly announced that the European\nCommission approved baricitinib as OLUMIANT for the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD in adult\npatients who are candidates for systemic therapy. In December 2020, baricitinib was approved by the MHLW\nfor the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe AD.\nAlopecia Areata.\nAlopecia areata is an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system attacks the\nhair follicles, causing hair loss in patches. In March 2020, Lilly announced that baricitinib received\nBreakthrough Therapy designation for the treatment of alopecia areata, based on the positive Phase II results\nof Lilly’s adaptive Phase II/III study BRAVE-AA1. In March 2021, we and Lilly announced positive results\nfrom BRAVE-AA2, the Phase III trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of once-daily baricitinib in adults\nwith severe alopecia areata. In April 2021, we and Lilly announced positive results from the Phase III portion\nof BRAVE-AA1. In September 2021, we and Lilly announced detailed results from BRAVE-AA1 and\nBRAVE-AA2 at the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology Congress (EADV). The two studies\nshowed statistically significant improvement in scalp hair regrowth across both baricitinib dosing groups when\ncompared to placebo. In March 2022, we and Lilly announced positive 52 week results from BRAVE-AA1\nand BRAVE-AA2 at the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) annual meeting showing 40% of adults\nsaw at least 80% scalp coverage. In June 2022, the FDA approved 2mg, and 4mg doses of OLUMIANT for the\ntreatment of adults with severe alopecia areata, becoming the first and only systemic treatment in the\nindication. In June 2022, OLUMIANT was approved as a treatment for alopecia areata in Europe and Japan.\nSystemic Lupus Erythematosus.\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic disease that causes\ninflammation. In addition to affecting the skin and joints, it can affect other organs in the body such as the\nkidneys, the tissue lining the lungs and heart, and the brain. Lilly has conducted a Phase II trial to evaluate the\nsafety and efficacy of baricitinib in patients with SLE. Baricitinib’s activity profile suggests that it inhibits\ncytokines implicated in SLE such as type I interferon (IFN), type II IFN-γ, IL-6, and IL-23 as well as other\ncytokines that may have a role in SLE, including granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor\n(GM-CSF) and IL-12.\nIn January 2022, Lilly announced the discontinuation of the Phase III development program for\nbaricitinib in SLE based on top-line efficacy results from two pivotal Phase III trials (SLE-BRAVE-I\nand — II). The primary endpoint of SRI-4 response was reached in SLE-BRAVE-I but was not reached in\nSLE-BRAVE-II and key secondary endpoints were not met in either study.\nCOVID-19. In May 2020, we amended our agreement with Lilly to enable Lilly to commercialize\nbaricitinib for the treatment of COVID-19. In November 2020, we and Lilly announced that the FDA issued\nan Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the distribution and emergency use of baricitinib to be used in\ncombination with remdesivir in hospitalized adult and pediatric patients two years of age or older with\nsuspected or laboratory confirmed COVID-19 who require supplemental oxygen, invasive mechanical\nventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. In December 2020, we and Lilly announced that data\nfrom ACTT-2 supportive of the EUA were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. In July 2021,\nwe and Lilly announced that the FDA broadened the EUA for baricitinib to allow for treatment with or\nwithout remdesivir. The EUA now provides for the use of baricitinib for treatment of COVID-19 in\nhospitalized adults and pediatric patients two years of age or older requiring supplemental oxygen, non-\ninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). In June 2022,\nwe and Lilly announced the FDA approved baricitinib as OLUMIANT for the treatment of COVID-19 in\nhospitalized adults requiring supplemental oxygen, non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO.\n19"

The investigational compound has\ndemonstrated inhibitory activity in cell-based biochemical and functional assays that measure MET signaling\nand MET dependent cell proliferation, survival and migration. Under our agreement, Novartis received\nworldwide exclusive development and commercialization rights to capmatinib and certain back-up compounds\nin all indications. Capmatinib is being evaluated in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, non-small cell lung\ncancer and other solid tumors, and may have potential utility as a combination agent.\nMET is a clinically validated receptor kinase cancer target. Abnormal MET activation in cancer correlates\nwith poor prognosis. Dysregulation of the MET pathway triggers tumor growth, formation of new blood\nvessels that supply the tumor with nutrients, and causes cancer to spread to other organs. Dysregulation of the\nMET pathway is seen in many types of cancers, including lung, kidney, liver, stomach, breast and brain.\nIn May 2020, we and Novartis announced the FDA approval of capmatinib as TABRECTA for the\ntreatment of adult patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have a mutation that leads to MET exon 14\nskipping (METex14) as detected by an FDA-approved test. TABRECTA is the first and only treatment\napproved to specifically target NSCLC with this driver mutation and is approved for first-line and previously\ntreated patients regardless of prior treatment type.\nThe FDA approval of TABRECTA was based on results from the pivotal GEOMETRY mono-1 study.\nIn the METex14 population (n=97), the confirmed overall response rate was 68% and 41% among treatment-\nnaive (n=28) and previously treated patients (n=69), respectively, based on the Blinded Independent Review\nCommittee (BIRC) assessment per RECIST v1.1. In patients taking TABRECTA, the study also demonstrated\na median duration of response of 12.6 months in treatment-naive patients (19 responders) and 9.7 months in\npreviously treated patients (28 responders). The most common treatment-related adverse events (AEs)\n(incidence ≥20%) are peripheral edema, nausea, fatigue, vomiting, dyspnea, and decreased appetite. In\nSeptember 2020, we and Novartis announced that GEOMETRY mono-1 results were published in The New\nEngland Journal of Medicine.\nIn June 2020, we and Novartis announced that the MHLW approved TABRECTA for METex14\nmutation-positive advanced and/or recurrent unresectable NSCLC. In April 2022, we and Novartis announced\na positive opinion from the CHMP based on data from the Phase II GEOMETRY mono-1 study showing an\noverall response rate (ORR) of 51.6% in a cohort evaluating second-line patients only and 44% in all\npreviously-treated patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring alterations leading\nto MET exon 14 skipping.\nIn June 2022, we and Novartis announced the European Commission approval of capmatinib as\nTABRECTA as monotherapy treatment of adults with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)\nharboring alterations leading to mesenchymal-epithelial-transition factor gene (MET) exon 14 (METex14)\nskipping who require systemic therapy following prior treatment with immunotherapy and/or platinum-based\nchemotherapy.\nNSCLC is the most common type of lung cancer, impacting more than 2 million people per year globally.\nApproximately 3-4 percent of all patients with NSCLC have tumors with a mutation that leads to MET exon\n14 skipping. Though rare, this mutation is an indicator of especially poor prognosis and poor responses to\nstandard therapies, including immunotherapy.\nRuxolitinib\nGraft-versus-host disease.\nIn March 2022, we and Novartis announced a positive opinion from the\nCHMP for ruxolitinib in acute and chronic GVHD, based on data from the Phase III REACH2 and REACH3\ntrials. GVHD is a life-threatening complication of stem cell transplants, with no established standard of care\nin Europe for patients who do not adequately respond to first-line steroid treatment. In May 2022, we and\nNovartis announced the EC approval of ruxolitinib as JAKAVI for the treatment of acute or chronic GVHD\nin patients aged 12 years and older who have inadequate response to corticosteroids or other systemic\ntherapies.\n20"

In addition to our small molecules expertise, we have\nadded a biologics discovery capability in-house and have expanded our discovery scope to include bispecific\nantibodies through a collaboration with Merus.\nThis discovery team operates in concert with an equally experienced drug development organization with\nexpertise in clinical sciences, statistics, and regulatory affairs. Our drug development organization manages\nour clinical programs and utilizes clinical research organizations (CROs), expert scientific advisory boards,\nand leading consultants and suppliers as appropriate to ensure our clinical trials are conducted efficiently,\neffectively, and in accordance with regulatory and compliance guidelines.\nTo succeed in our objective to discover and advance novel therapeutics that address serious unmet medical\nneeds, we have established a broad range of discovery capabilities in-house, including target validation, high-\nthroughput screening, medicinal chemistry, computational chemistry, structural biology, pharmacological and\ntranslational sciences, ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) and toxicology\nassessment. We augment these capabilities through collaborations with academic and contract laboratory\nresources with relevant expertise.\nDriven by a target- and pathway-centric discovery process, our pipeline has grown and is currently focused\nprimarily in targeted oncology. We conduct a limited number of discovery programs in parallel at any one\ntime. This focus allows us to allocate resources to our selected programs at a level that we believe is competitive\nwith larger pharmaceutical companies. We resource our discovery efforts with the goals of maximizing\ninformation content when and where we need it and ensuring that each program, regardless of stage, is\nexecuted in the most efficient and data-rich manner possible. We believe this approach has played a critical\nrole in the development of our product portfolio.\nOnce our compounds reach clinical development, our objective is to rapidly progress the lead candidate\ninto a proof-of-concept clinical trial to assess quickly the therapeutic potential of the clinical candidate itself\nas well as its underlying mechanism of action. This information is then used to evaluate the compound’s\ndevelopment opportunities, identify the most appropriate indication(s) to pursue, and develop a clinical and\nregulatory plan to advance the molecule.\n23"

Our development teams\ninclude employees with expertise in drug development, including clinical trial design, statistics, regulatory\naffairs, medical affairs, pharmacovigilance and project management. We have also built internal chemistry,\nmanufacturing and controls, and formulation teams that work closely with external GMP contract\nmanufacturers to support our drug development efforts.\nIncyte’s Commercial Strategy\nOur strategy is to develop and commercialize compounds that we have internally discovered or have\nacquired rights to in the markets where we believe that a company of our size can successfully compete. We\ncurrently commercialize four compounds in the United States, three in Europe and one in Japan. These\ncommercialized products are sold to specialty and retail pharmacies, specialty distributors and wholesalers in\nthe United States in addition to retail pharmacies, hospital pharmacies, distributors and an exclusive\nwholesaler outside of the United States. We continue to expand our marketing, medical and operational\ninfrastructure within the United States and outside of the United States to support the commercial launch of\nrecently approved products and to prepare for potential approval of other products.\nFor certain compounds, we have established and may in the future establish collaborations or strategic\nrelationships to support development and commercialization in certain territories or therapeutic areas where\nwe do not have or do not want to build expertise. We believe the key benefits to entering into such strategic\nrelationships include the potential to expedite the development and commercialization of certain of our\ncompounds, as well as the opportunity to receive upfront payments and future milestones and royalties in\nexchange for certain rights to those compounds. Refer to the “License Agreements and Business\nRelationships” section above for information regarding our collaborations and strategic relationships.\nPatents and Other Intellectual Property\nWe regard the protection of patents and other enforceable intellectual property rights that we own or\nlicense as critical to our business and competitive position. Accordingly, we rely on patent, trademark, trade\nsecret and copyright law, as well as nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements, to protect our\nintellectual property. We have established a patent portfolio of patents and patent applications owned or\nlicensed by us that cover aspects of all our drug products and drug candidates. The patents and patent\napplications relating to our drug products and drug candidates generally include claims directed to the\ncompounds, methods of using the compounds, formulations of the compounds, pharmaceutical salt forms of\nthe compounds, and methods of manufacturing the compounds. Our policy is to pursue patent applications\non inventions and discoveries that we believe are commercially important to the development and growth of\nour business.

In some\ncases, governmental authorities have indicated that where pharmaceutical companies do not do so, their\npatents might not be enforceable to prevent generic competition. Some major pharmaceutical companies have\ngreatly reduced prices for their drugs in certain developing countries. If certain countries do not permit\nenforcement of any of our patents, sales of our products in those countries, and in other countries by\nimportation from low-price countries, could be reduced by generic competition or by parallel importation of\nour product. Alternatively, governments in those countries could require that we grant compulsory licenses to\nallow competitors to manufacture and sell their own versions of our products in those countries, thereby\nreducing our product sales, or we could respond to governmental concerns by reducing prices for our products.\nIn all of these situations, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nGovernment Regulation\nOur ongoing research and development activities and any manufacturing and marketing of our approved\ndrug products and our drug candidates are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental\nauthorities in the United States and other countries. Before marketing in the United States, any drug developed\nby us must undergo rigorous preclinical testing, clinical trials, and an extensive regulatory clearance process\nimplemented by the FDA under the United States Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and its implementing\nregulations and, in the case of biologics, the Public Health Service Act. The FDA regulates, among other\nthings, the research, development, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, record-keeping, labeling, storage,\napproval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution and import and export, of these products.\nFDA Review and Approval Process\nThe regulatory review and approval process is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. The steps generally\nrequired before a drug may be marketed in the United States include:\n• preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s Good\nLaboratory Practice and Good Manufacturing Practice regulations;\n• submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application (IND) for human clinical testing,\nwhich must become effective before human clinical trials may commence;\n• performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in three phases, as described below, to\nestablish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each indication;\n• submission of an NDA or Biologics License Application (BLA) to the FDA for review;\n• random inspections of clinical sites to ensure validity of clinical safety and efficacy data;\n• satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the\ndrug is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices;\n• FDA approval of the NDA or BLA; and\n• payment of user and program fees, if applicable.\nSimilar requirements exist within foreign agencies as well. The time required to satisfy FDA requirements\nor similar requirements of foreign regulatory agencies may vary substantially based on the type, complexity\nand novelty of the product or the targeted disease.\nPreclinical testing includes laboratory evaluation of product pharmacology, drug metabolism, and\ntoxicity which includes animal studies, to assess potential safety and efficacy as well as product chemistry,\nstability, formulation, development, and testing. The results of the preclinical tests, together with\nmanufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND will\nautomatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time, the FDA raises safety\nconcerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial(s) included in the IND. In the latter case, the IND\n27"

We cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to\ncommence.\nClinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the\nsupervision of qualified investigators and in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) regulations\ncovering the protection of human subjects. These regulations require all research subjects to provide informed\nconsent. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the study, the parameters to\nbe used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted\nto the FDA as part of the IND and each trial must be reviewed and approved by an institutional review board\n(IRB) before it can begin.\nClinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be\ncombined. Phase I usually involves the initial introduction of the investigational drug into healthy volunteers\nto evaluate its safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. Phase II usually\ninvolves clinical trials in a limited patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, identify\npossible adverse effects and safety risks, and evaluate and gain preliminary evidence of the efficacy of the drug\nfor specific indications. Phase III clinical trials usually further evaluate clinical efficacy and safety by testing\nthe drug in its final form in an expanded patient population, providing statistical evidence of efficacy and\nsafety, and providing an adequate basis for labeling. We cannot guarantee that Phase I, Phase II or Phase III\ntesting will be completed successfully within any specified period of time, if at all. Furthermore, we, the IRB,\nor the FDA may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or\npatients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.\nAs a separate amendment to an IND, a clinical trial sponsor may submit to the FDA a request for a\nSpecial Protocol Assessment (SPA). Under the SPA procedure, a sponsor may seek the FDA’s agreement on\nthe design and size of a clinical trial intended to form the primary basis of an effectiveness claim. If the FDA\nagrees in writing, its agreement may not be changed after the trial begins, except when agreed by FDA or in\nlimited circumstances, such as when a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety and\neffectiveness of a drug candidate is identified after a Phase III clinical trial is commenced and agreement is\nobtained with the FDA. If the outcome of the trial is successful, the sponsor will ordinarily be able to rely on\nit as the primary basis for approval with respect to effectiveness. However, additional trials could also be\nrequested by the FDA to support approval, and the FDA may make an approval decision based on a number\nof factors, including the degree of clinical benefit as well as safety. The FDA is not obligated to approve an\nNDA or BLA as a result of an SPA agreement, even if the clinical outcome is positive.\nEven after initial FDA approval has been obtained, post-approval trials, or Phase IV studies, may be\nrequired to provide additional data, and will be required to obtain approval for the sale of a product as a\ntreatment for a clinical indication other than that for which the product was initially tested and approved.\nAlso, the FDA will require post-approval safety reporting to monitor the side effects of the drug. Results of\npost-approval programs may limit or expand the indication or indications for which the drug product may be\nmarketed. Further, if there are any requests for modifications to the initial FDA approval for the drug,\nincluding changes in indication, manufacturing process, manufacturing facilities, or labeling, a supplemental\nNDA or BLA may be required to be submitted to the FDA.\nThe length of time and related costs necessary to complete clinical trials varies significantly and may be\ndifficult to predict. Clinical results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay, limit or\nprevent regulatory approvals. Additional factors that can cause delay or termination of our clinical trials, or\ncause the costs of these clinical trials to increase, include:\n• slow patient enrollment due to the nature of the protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the\neligibility criteria for the study, competition with clinical trials for other drug candidates or other\nfactors;\n• inadequately trained or insufficient personnel at the study site to assist in overseeing and monitoring\nclinical trials;\n• delays in approvals from a study site’s IRB;\n28"

Unacceptable toxicities or\nside effects may occur at any dose level, and at any time in the course of animal studies designed to identify\nunacceptable effects of a drug candidate, known as toxicological studies, or in clinical trials of our drug\ncandidates. The appearance of any unacceptable toxicity or side effect could cause us or regulatory authorities\nto interrupt, limit, delay or abort the development of any of our drug candidates, and could ultimately prevent\ntheir marketing approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications.\nThe FDA’s fast track, breakthrough therapy, accelerated approval, and priority review designation\nprograms are intended to facilitate the development and expedite the review and approval of drug candidates\nintended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening conditions and that demonstrate the potential to\naddress unmet medical needs for these conditions. Under these programs, FDA can, for example, review\nportions of an NDA or BLA for a drug candidate before the entire application is complete, thus potentially\nbeginning the review process at an earlier time. The FDA, however, can mandate, and has mandated, post-\napproval requirements that could include lengthy and extensive confirmatory clinical trials. The FDA has\nrecently increased its focus on accelerated approvals for oncology drugs and the confirmatory trials required\nfor those drugs.\nWe cannot guarantee that the FDA will grant any of our requests for any of these expedited program\ndesignations, that any such designations would affect the time of review or that the FDA will approve the\nNDA or BLA submitted for any of our drug candidates, whether or not these designations are granted.\nAdditionally, FDA approval of a product can include restrictions on the product’s use or distribution (such as\npermitting use only for specified medical conditions or limiting distribution to physicians or facilities with\nspecial training or experience). Approval of such designated products can be conditioned on additional clinical\ntrials after approval.\nSponsors submit the results of preclinical studies and clinical trials to the FDA as part of an NDA or\nBLA. NDAs and BLAs must also contain extensive product manufacturing information and proposed\nlabeling. Upon receipt, the FDA initially reviews the NDA or BLA to determine whether it is sufficiently\ncomplete to initiate a substantive review. If the FDA identifies deficiencies that would preclude substantive\nreview, the FDA will refuse to accept the NDA or BLA and will inform the sponsor of the deficiencies that\nmust be corrected prior to resubmission. If the FDA accepts the submission for review (then deemed a\n“filing”), the FDA typically completes the NDA or BLA review within a pre-determined time frame. Under\nthe Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the FDA agrees to review NDAs and BLAs under either a standard\nreview or priority review. FDA procedures provide for priority review of NDAs and BLAs submitted for\ndrugs that, compared to currently marketed products, if any, offer a significant improvement in the treatment,\ndiagnosis or prevention of a disease. The FDA seeks to review NDAs and BLAs that are granted priority\nstatus more quickly than NDAs and BLAs given standard review status. The FDA’s stated policy is to act on\n90% of priority NDAs and BLAs within eight months of receipt (or six months after filing, which occurs\nwithin 60 days after NDA or BLA submission). Although the FDA historically has not met these goals, the\nagency has made significant improvements in the timeliness of the review process. NDA and BLA review\noften extends beyond anticipated completion dates due to FDA requests for additional data or clarification,\nthe submission of a major amendment by the Sponsor, the FDA’s decision to have an advisory committee\nreview, and difficulties in scheduling an advisory committee meeting. The recommendations of an advisory\ncommittee are not binding on the FDA.\nTo obtain FDA approval to market a product, we must demonstrate that the product is safe and effective\nfor the patient population that will be treated. If regulatory approval of a product is granted, the approval will\nbe limited to those disease states and conditions for which the product is safe and effective, as demonstrated\nthrough clinical trials. Marketing or promoting a drug for an unapproved indication is prohibited.\n29"

If an NDA or BLA does not satisfy applicable\nregulatory criteria, the FDA may deny approval of an NDA or BLA or may issue a complete response, and\nrequire, among other things, additional clinical data or analyses.\nThe Orphan Drug Act provides incentives to manufacturers to develop and market drugs for rare diseases\nand conditions affecting fewer than 200,000 persons in the United States at the time of application for orphan\ndrug designation or conditions affecting 200,000 or more people in the United States where the disease or\ncondition occurs so infrequently that there is no reasonable expectation that the costs of drug development\nand marketing will be recovered in future sales of the drug in the United States. The first developer to receive\nFDA marketing approval for an orphan drug is entitled to a seven year exclusive marketing period in the\nUnited States for the orphan drug indication. However, a drug that the FDA considers to be clinically superior\nto, or different from, another approved orphan drug, even though for the same indication, may also obtain\napproval in the United States during the seven year exclusive marketing period.\nRegulation of Manufacturing Process\nEven when NDA or BLA approval is obtained, a marketed product, such as JAKAFI, its manufacturer\nand its manufacturing facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA. The\nmanufacturing process for pharmaceutical products is highly regulated and regulators may shut down\nmanufacturing facilities that they believe do not comply with regulations. Discovery of previously unknown\nproblems with a product, manufacturer or facility may result in restrictions on the product, manufacturer or\nfacility, including costly recalls or withdrawal of the product from the market. Manufacturing facilities are\nalways subject to inspection by the applicable regulatory authorities.\nWe and our third-party manufacturers are subject to current Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMP,\nwhich are extensive regulations governing manufacturing processes, including but not limited to stability\ntesting, record keeping and quality standards as defined by the International Council for Harmonisation of\nTechnical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, or ICH, FDA and the European Medicines\nAgency. Similar regulations are in effect in other countries. Manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection\nby the applicable regulatory authorities and are subject to manufacturing licenses where applicable. These\nfacilities, whether our own or our contract manufacturers, must be inspected before we can use them in\ncommercial manufacturing of our related products. We or our contract manufacturers may not be able to\ncomply with applicable GMP and FDA or other regulatory requirements. If we or our contract manufacturers\nfail to comply, we or our contract manufacturers may be subject to legal or regulatory action, such as\nsuspension of manufacturing license, seizure of product, or voluntary recall of product. Furthermore,\ncontinued compliance with applicable GMP will require continual expenditure of time, money and effort on\nthe part of us or our contract manufacturers in the areas of production and quality control and record keeping\nand reporting, in order to ensure full compliance.\nPost-Approval Regulation\nAny products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and\ncontinuing regulation by the FDA, including record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences\nwith the drug and other reporting, advertising and promotion restrictions. The FDA’s rules for advertising\nand promotion require, among other things, that our promotion be fairly balanced and adequately\nsubstantiated by clinical studies, and that we not promote our products for unapproved uses. We must also\nsubmit appropriate new and supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the\napproved product, product labeling or manufacturing process. On its own initiative, the FDA may require\nchanges to the labeling of an approved drug if it becomes aware of new safety information that the agency\nbelieves should be included in the approved drug’s labeling. The FDA also enforces the requirements of the\nPrescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which, among other things, imposes various requirements in\nconnection with the distribution of product samples to physicians.\nIn addition to inspections related to manufacturing, we are subject to periodic unannounced inspections\nby the FDA and other regulatory bodies related to the other regulatory requirements that apply to marketed\ndrugs manufactured or distributed by us. The FDA also may conduct periodic inspections regarding our\n30"

When the FDA conducts an inspection, the inspectors will identify\nany deficiencies they believe exist in the form of a notice of inspectional observations. The observations may\nbe more or less significant. If we receive a notice of inspectional observations, we likely will be required to\nrespond in writing, and may be required to undertake corrective and preventive actions in order to address the\nFDA’s concerns.\nThere are a variety of state laws and regulations that apply in the states or localities where JAKAFI and\nour drug candidates are or may be marketed. For example, we must comply with state laws that require the\nregistration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products in that state, including,\nin certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers\nor distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on\nmanufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including\nsome states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing\nproduct as it moves through the distribution chain. Any applicable state or local regulations may hinder our\nability to market, or increase the cost of marketing, our products in those states or localities.\nThe FDA’s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could impose\nadditional burdens or limitations on our ability to market products after approval. Moreover, increased\nattention to the containment of health care costs in the United States and in foreign markets could result in\nnew government regulations which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict the\nlikelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation which might arise from future legislative or\nadministrative action, either in the United States or abroad.\nMarketing Exclusivity\nThe FDA may grant five years of exclusivity in the United States for the approval of NDAs for new\nchemical entities, and three years of exclusivity for supplemental NDAs, for among other things, new\nindications, dosages or dosage forms of an existing drug if new clinical investigations that were conducted or\nsponsored by the applicant are essential to the approval of the supplemental application. Additionally,\nsix months of marketing exclusivity in the United States is available if, in response to a written request from\nthe FDA, a sponsor submits and the agency accepts requested information relating to the use of the approved\ndrug in the pediatric population. The six month pediatric exclusivity is added to any existing patent or non-\npatent exclusivity period for which the drug is eligible. Orphan drug products are also eligible for pediatric\nexclusivity if the FDA requests and the company completes pediatric clinical trials. Under the Biologics Price\nCompetition and Innovation Act, the FDA may grant 12 years of data exclusivity for innovative biological\nproducts.\nForeign Regulation\nOutside the United States, our ability to market a product is contingent upon receiving a marketing\nauthorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical\ntrials, marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. At present,\nforeign marketing authorizations are applied for at a national level, although within the European Union\n(EU) regional registration procedures are available to companies wishing to market a product in more than\none EU member state. If the competent regulatory authority is satisfied that adequate evidence of safety,\nquality and efficacy has been presented, a marketing authorization may be granted. This foreign regulatory\napproval process involves all of the risks associated with FDA approval discussed above and may also include\nadditional risks.\nWhether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from\nregulatory authorities in non-US countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the\nproduct in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a process that requires the\nsubmission of a clinical trial application, or CTA, much like an IND prior to the commencement of human\nclinical trials. In the European Union, a CTA must be submitted for each trial to the competent health\nauthority and to independent ethics committees by national procedure for a single country trial or by EMA\nsubmission portal CTIS for a multinational study.

Drugs can be\nauthorized in the EU by using the centralized, mutual recognition, decentralized or national authorization\nprocedures described below.\nThe European Medicines Agency implemented the centralized procedure for the approval of human\ndrugs to facilitate marketing authorizations that are valid throughout the EU. This procedure results in a\nsingle marketing authorization granted by the European Commission that is valid across the EU. Under the\ncentralized procedure, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application\nby the EMA is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided\nby the applicant in response to questions asked by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use). A\npositive opinion on the MAA by the CHMP then needs to be endorsed by the European Commission within\napproximately 67 days. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, in which\ncase the EMA ensures that the evaluation for the opinion of the CHMP is completed within 150 days\n(excluding clock stops) and the opinion issued thereafter.\nThe mutual recognition procedure (MRP) for the approval of human drugs is an alternative approach to\nfacilitate individual national marketing authorizations within the EU. The MRP may be applied for all human\ndrugs for which the centralized procedure is not obligatory. The MRP is based on the principle of the mutual\nrecognition by EU member states of their respective national marketing authorizations. Based on a marketing\nauthorization in the reference member state, the applicant may apply for marketing authorizations in other\nmember states. In such case, the reference member state shall update its existing assessment report about the\ndrug. After the assessment is completed, copies of the report are sent to all member states, together with the\napproved summary of product characteristics, labeling and package leaflet. The concerned member states\nthen recognize the decision of the reference member state and the summary of product characteristics, labeling\nand package leaflet. National marketing authorizations shall be granted within 30 days after acknowledgement\nof the agreement.\nShould any member state refuse to recognize the marketing authorization by the reference member state,\nthe member states shall make all efforts to reach a consensus. If this fails, the procedure is submitted to an\nEMA scientific committee for arbitration. The opinion of this EMA Committee is then forwarded to the\nCommission, for the start of the decision making process. As in the centralized procedure, this process entails\nconsulting various European Commission Directorates General and the Standing Committee on Human\nMedicinal Products or Veterinary Medicinal Products, as appropriate.\nLegislation similar to the Orphan Drug Act has been enacted in other countries outside of the United\nStates, including the EU. The orphan legislation in the EU is available for therapies addressing conditions that\naffect five or fewer out of 10,000 persons, are life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions and for\nwhich no satisfactory treatment is authorized. The market exclusivity period is for ten years, although that\nperiod can be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, available evidence establishes that the product\ndoes not justify maintenance of market exclusivity.\nFor other countries outside of the EU, such as non-EU countries in Eastern Europe, Middle-East, Latin\nAmerica, Japan or other countries in Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product\nlicensing, pricing and reimbursement vary. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance\nwith GCP and the other applicable regulatory requirements.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other\nthings, fines, suspension of clinical trials, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls,\nseizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.\nManufacturing\nOur manufacturing strategy is to contract with third parties to manufacture the raw materials, our active\npharmaceutical ingredients, or API, and finished dosage form for clinical and commercial uses.

As such, we expect to\ncontinue to rely on third parties for the manufacture of commercial supplies of the raw materials, API and\nfinished drug product for drugs that we successfully develop and are approved for commercial sale. In this\nmanner, we continue to build and maintain our supply chain and quality assurance resources.\nIn July 2018, we purchased land located in Yverdon, Switzerland for construction of a large molecule\nproduction facility to manufacture biologic drug substances for our drug candidates. Construction activity\ncommenced in July 2018, and inspection from competent authorities was finalized in March 2022, and in\nJune 2022 Swissmedic authorities granted the GMP drug manufacturing license for this facility. The Yverdon\nfacility started to manufacture MONJUVI/MINJUVI drug substance during the fourth quarter of 2022. The\ndrug substance will be usable in patients after regulatory approval, which is currently expected in the first\nquarter of 2024 for the European market and in the fourth quarter of 2024 in the U.S.\nManufacturing of our Products\nOur supply chain for manufacturing raw materials, API and drug product ready for distribution and\ncommercialization is a multi-step international process. Establishing and managing the supply chain requires\na significant financial commitment and the creation and maintenance of numerous third-party contractual\nrelationships.\nWe contract with third parties to manufacture JAKAFI, ICLUSIG, PEMAZYRE, OPZELURA and\nour drug candidates for clinical and commercial purposes. Our collaborator MorphoSys is currently\nresponsible for sourcing manufacturing of MONJUVI/MINJUVI. Third-party manufacturers supply raw\nmaterials, and other third-party manufacturers convert these raw materials into API or convert the API into\nfinal dosage form. For most of our drug candidates, once our raw materials are produced, we rely on one\nthird-party to manufacture the API, another to make finished drug product and a third to package and label\nthe finished product. For ruxolitinib phosphate, the API for JAKAFI and OPZELURA, we have two qualified\nthird-party contract manufacturers from which we can source drug substance. The manufacturing of\nponatinib, the API for ICLUSIG, is the sole responsibility of Takeda, the intellectual property holder. We\nprocure API from Takeda, which outsources the API manufacturing to a third party. For pemigatinib, the API\nfor PEMAZYRE, we have one qualified third-party contract manufacturer from which we can source drug\nsubstance.\nWe also rely on third-party contract manufacturers to tablet or capsulate all of our active pharmaceutical\ningredients for clinical and commercial uses. For JAKAFI and ICLUSIG, we have two qualified third-party\nmanufacturers from which we can source commercial drug product. Secondary packaging of ICLUSIG is\nperformed by a qualified third-party manufacturer. Primary packaged product for ICLUSIG can be used for\nclinical and commercial purposes. For PEMAZYRE, we have one qualified third-party manufacturer from\nwhich we can source commercial drug product. For OPZELURA, we have one qualified third-party\nmanufacturer from which we can source commercial drug product.\nWe may not be able to obtain sufficient quantities of any of our raw materials, drug candidates, API, or\nfinished goods if our designated manufacturers do not have the capacity or capability to manufacture our\nproducts according to our schedule and specifications. If any of these single source suppliers were to become\nunable or unwilling to supply us with API or finished product that complies with applicable regulatory\nrequirements, we could incur significant delays in our clinical trials or interruption of commercial supply\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on our business. Similar risks apply to our supply of MONJUVI/\nMINJUVI under our collaboration with MorphoSys.\nWe have established a quality assurance program intended to ensure that our third-party manufacturers\nand service providers produce materials and provide services, as applicable, in accordance with the FDA and\nEMA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices and other applicable regulations. Our quality assurance\nprogram extends to our licensed facilities that oversee the manufacturing and distribution activities.\nFor our future products, we intend to continue to establish third-party suppliers to manufacture sufficient\nquantities of our drug candidates to undertake clinical trials and to manufacture sufficient quantities of any\nproduct that is approved for commercial sale.

If we or any of our third-party\nmanufacturers fail to perform as required, this could impair our ability to deliver our products on a timely\nbasis or cause delays in our clinical trials and applications for regulatory approval. To the extent these risks\nmaterialize and affect their performance obligations to us, our financial results may be adversely affected.\nFor products manufactured by our third-party manufacturers, we have licensed the necessary aspects of\nthis manufacturing technology that we believe is proprietary to us to enable them to manufacture the products\nfor us. We have agreements with these third-party manufacturers that are intended to restrict these\nmanufacturers from using or revealing our technology, but we cannot be certain that these third-party\nmanufacturers will comply with these restrictions.\nWhile we believe there are multiple third parties capable of providing most of the materials and services\nwe need in order to manufacture API and distribute finished goods, and that supply of materials that cannot\nbe second sourced can be managed with inventory planning, there is always a risk that we may underestimate\ndemand, and that our manufacturing capacity through third-party manufacturers may not be sufficient. In\naddition, because of the significant lead times involved in our supply chain for ruxolitinib phosphate, we may\nhave less flexibility to adjust our supply in response to changes in demand than if we had shorter lead times.\nOur strategy is to maintain 18 to 24 months of safety stock of API to be able to respond to changes in demand\nto provide on-time supply of drug product as well as at least 6 months of semi-finished goods inventory.\nAccess to Supplies and Materials\nOur third-party manufacturers need access to certain supplies and products to manufacture our products\nand drug candidates. If delivery of material from their suppliers were interrupted for any reason or if they are\nunable to purchase sufficient quantities of raw materials used to manufacture our products and drug\ncandidates, they may be unable to ship our products for commercial supply or to supply our drug candidates\nin development for clinical trials. For example, currently raw materials used to manufacture ruxolitinib\nphosphate, the API in JAKAFI and OPZELURA, are supplied by Chinese-based companies. As a result, an\ninternational trade dispute between China and the United States or any other actions by the Chinese\ngovernment that would limit or prevent Chinese companies from supplying these materials would adversely\naffect our ability to manufacture and supply our products to meet market needs and have a material and\nadverse effect on our operating results.\nHuman Capital\nOur human capital management philosophy is committed to promoting an environment where our\ncolleagues are fulfilled and valued. We promote a company culture based on scientific excellence as we seek to\ncreate new treatments; we are creative in our development strategies; and we seek positive collaboration with\neach other. Working collaboratively is of the utmost importance as we aim to change the treatment landscape\nfor patients with cancer and inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. It is our goal to conduct business in a\nmanner that does not compromise the health of people nor the state of the environment. It is our policy to\ncomply with all applicable environmental, health and safety (EHS) regulatory requirements and seek to\ncontinually improve our EHS management systems.

If we are unable to maintain revenues from JAKAFI or those revenues decrease, our business may be\nmaterially harmed.\nJAKAFI is our first product marketed by us that is approved for sale in the United States. JAKAFI was\napproved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in November 2011 for the treatment of patients\nwith intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis, in December 2014 for the treatment of patients with\npolycythemia vera who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant of hydroxyurea, which we refer\nto as uncontrolled polycythemia vera, in May 2019 for the treatment of steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-\nhost disease in adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older and in September 2021 for the treatment of\nsteroid-refractory chronic graft-versus-host disease in adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older.\nAlthough we have received regulatory approval for these indications, such approval does not guarantee future\nrevenues. While we also sell ICLUSIG in the European Union, or EU, and other countries for the treatment of\ncertain types of leukemia, PEMAZYRE in the United States, Europe and Japan for the treatment of certain\nmetastatic cholangiocarcinoma indications, as well as for certain blood cancer indications in the United States,\nMONJUVI in the United States and MINJUVI in the European Union for the treatment of certain lymphoma\nindications, and OPZELURA in the Unites States for the treatment of certain indications of atopic dermatitis\nand vitiligo, and our exclusive licensees sell OLUMIANT (baricitinib) for the treatment of specified\nrheumatoid arthritis and atopic dermatitis indications and TABRECTA for the treatment of a certain type of\nnon-small cell lung cancer, we anticipate that JAKAFI product sales will continue to contribute a\nsignificant percentage of our total revenues over the next several years.\nThe commercial success of JAKAFI and our ability to maintain and continue to increase revenues from\nthe sale of JAKAFI will depend on a number of factors, including:\n• the number of patients with intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis, uncontrolled polycythemia vera\nor steroid-refractory graft-versus-host disease who are diagnosed with the diseases and the number of\nsuch patients that may be treated with JAKAFI;\n• the acceptance of JAKAFI by patients and the healthcare community;\n• whether physicians, patients and healthcare payors view JAKAFI as therapeutically effective and safe\nrelative to cost and any alternative therapies, as well as whether patients will continue to use JAKAFI;\n• the ability to obtain and maintain sufficient coverage or reimbursement by third-party payors and\npricing;\n• the ability of our third-party manufacturers to manufacture JAKAFI in sufficient quantities that meet\nall applicable quality standards;\n• the ability of our company and our third-party providers to provide marketing and distribution support\nfor JAKAFI;\n• the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, any associated quarantine, travel restriction, stay-at-home or\nshutdown orders, guidelines or practices, and any disruption in our supply chain for JAKAFI on our\nability to provide marketing and distribution support for JAKAFI, our ability to produce sufficient\nquantities of JAKAFI that meet all applicable quality standards, patient demand (including new patient\nprescriptions and hesitancy of patients to make office visits) and other risks detailed further below\nunder “— Other Risks Relating to our Business — Public health epidemics, such as the COVID-19\npandemic, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition”;\n• the label and promotional claims allowed by the FDA;\n• the maintenance of regulatory approval for the approved indications in the United States; and\n• our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize ruxolitinib in the United\nStates for additional indications or in combination with other therapeutic modalities.\n36"

We may not be able to sell our products on a profitable basis or our profitability may be reduced if we\nare required to sell our products at lower than anticipated prices or reimbursement is unavailable or limited in\nscope or amount. The costs of JAKAFI, ICLUSIG, PEMAZYRE, MONJUVI/MINJUVI and OPZELURA\nare not insignificant and almost all patients will require some form of third-party coverage to afford their cost.\nOur future revenues and profitability will be adversely affected if we cannot depend on government and other\nthird-party payors to defray the cost of our products to the patient.\nGovernments and other third-party payors continue to pursue initiatives to manage drug costs. Pricing\nand reimbursement for our products may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including;\n• actions of federal, state and foreign governments and other third-party payors to implement or modify\nlaws, regulations or policies addressing payment and reimbursement for drugs;\n• pressure by employers on private health insurance plans to reduce costs or moderate cost increases, as\nwell as continued public scrutiny of the price of drugs and other healthcare costs; and\n• consolidation of third-party payors and continued initiatives of government and other third-party\npayors to reduce costs by seeking price discounts or rebates, reducing reimbursement rates or imposing\nrestrictions on access to or coverage of particular drugs based on perceived value.\nIn many markets outside of the United States, including countries of the EU, drug pricing and\nreimbursement are subject to government control, and government authorities are making greater efforts to\nlimit or regulate the price of drug products. Reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly\nby country and by region, and reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a country-by-country basis.\nReimbursement in the EU must be negotiated on a country-by-country basis and in many countries a drug\nproduct cannot be commercially launched until reimbursement is approved. The timing to complete the\nnegotiation process in each country is highly uncertain, and in some countries, we expect that it may exceed\n12 months. Some countries set prices by reference to prices in other countries, and countries may refuse to\nreimburse or may restrict the reimbursed population for a drug product based on their national health\ntechnology assessments and cost effectiveness thresholds. In addition, governmental authorities in many\ncountries may reduce prices for approved drug products from previously established prices.\nThird-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, and\npayors and employers are adopting benefit plan changes that shift a greater portion of prescription drug costs\nto patients. Third party pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, other similar organizations and payors can\nlimit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the\napproved products for a particular indication, and to exclude drugs from their formularies in favor of\ncompetitor drugs or alternative treatments, or place drugs on formulary tiers with higher patient co-pay\n37"

Formulary exclusion effectively encourages patients\nand providers to seek alternative treatments, make a complex and time-intensive request for medical\nexemptions, or pay 100% of the cost of a drug. In addition, in many instances, certain PBMs, other similar\norganizations and third party payors may exert negotiating leverage by requiring incremental rebates, discounts\nor other concessions from manufacturers in order to maintain formulary positions, which could continue to\nresult in higher gross to net deductions for affected products. There has been significant consolidation in the\nhealth insurance industry, resulting in large insurers and PBMs exerting greater pressure and leverage in pricing\nand usage negotiations with drug manufacturers. In this regard, while we have entered into agreements with a\nnumber of PBMs, we are in the process of negotiating agreements with additional PBMs and payor accounts\nto provide rebates to those entities related to formulary coverage for OPZELURA, and we cannot guarantee\nthat we will be able to agree to or maintain acceptable coverage terms with these PBMs and other third party\npayors. Payors could decide to exclude OPZELURA from formulary coverage lists, impose step edits that\nrequire patients to try alternative, including generic, treatments before authorizing payment for OPZELURA,\nlimit the types of diagnoses for which coverage will be provided or impose a moratorium on coverage for\nproducts while the payor makes a coverage decision. An inability to maintain adequate formulary positions\ncould increase patient cost-sharing for OPZELURA and cause some patients to determine not to use\nOPZELURA. Any delays or unforeseen difficulties in reimbursement approvals could limit patient access,\ndepress therapy adherence rates, and adversely impact our ability to successfully commercialize OPZELURA.\nIf we are unsuccessful in obtaining and maintaining broad coverage and reimbursement for OPZELURA, our\nanticipated revenue from and growth prospects for OPZELURA could be negatively affected.\nIf third parties institute high co-payment amounts or other benefit limits for our products, the demand\nfor our products and, accordingly, our revenues and results of operations, could be adversely affected. Our\npatient assistance programs have provided support for non-profit organizations that provide financial\nassistance to eligible patients or in some cases, we have provided our products without charge to eligible\npatients who have no insurance coverage or are underinsured. Substantial support in this manner could harm\nour profitability in the future. Further, non-profit organizations’ ability to provide assistance to patients is\ndependent on funding from external sources, and we cannot guarantee that such funding will be provided at\nadequate levels, or at all.\nRisks related to proposed changes in government regulations and health care reform measures are\ndescribed below under “— Other Risks Relating to our Business — Health care reform measures could impact\nthe pricing and profitability of pharmaceuticals, and adversely affect the commercial viability of our or our\ncollaborators’ products and drug candidates. “ If government and other third-party payors refuse to provide\ncoverage and reimbursement with respect to our products, determine to provide a lower level of coverage and\nreimbursement than anticipated, reduce previously approved levels of coverage and reimbursement, or delay\nreimbursement payments due to budgetary constraints relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, then our pricing\nor reimbursement for our products may be affected and our product sales, results of operations or financial\ncondition could be harmed. Our collaborators Novartis and Eli Lilly are affected by similar considerations for\nthe drugs that they market and for which we may receive royalties.\nWe depend upon a limited number of specialty pharmacies and wholesalers for a significant portion of any\nrevenues from JAKAFI and most of our other drug products, and the loss of, or significant reduction in sales to,\nany one of these specialty pharmacies or wholesalers could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nWe sell JAKAFI and our other drug products other than OPZELURA primarily to specialty pharmacies\nand wholesalers. Specialty pharmacies dispense JAKAFI and our other drug products to patients in fulfillment\nof prescriptions and wholesalers sell JAKAFI and our other drug products to hospitals and physician offices.\nWe do not promote JAKAFI or our other drug products to specialty pharmacies or wholesalers, and they do\nnot set or determine demand for JAKAFI or our other drug products. Our ability to successfully commercialize\nJAKAFI and our other drug products will depend, in part, on the extent to which we are able to provide\nadequate distribution of JAKAFI and our other drug products to patients. Although we have contracted with\na number of specialty pharmacies and wholesalers, they are expected generally to carry a very limited inventory\nand may be reluctant to be part of our distribution network in the future if demand for the product does not\nincrease. Further, it is possible that these specialty pharmacies and wholesalers could decide to change their\npolicies or fees, or both, at some time in the future. This could result in their refusal to carry smaller volume\nproducts such as JAKAFI and our other drug products, or lower margins or the need to find alternative\n38"

Although we believe we can find alternative channels to distribute\nJAKAFI or our other drug products on relatively short notice, our revenue during that period of time may\nsuffer and we may incur additional costs to replace any such specialty pharmacy or wholesaler. The loss of any\nlarge specialty pharmacy or wholesaler as part of our distribution network, a significant reduction in sales we\nmake to specialty pharmacies or wholesalers, or any failure to pay for the products we have shipped to them\ncould materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to establish and maintain effective sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, or to enter into\nagreements with third parties to do so, we will not be able to successfully commercialize our products.\nWe have established commercial capabilities in the United States and outside of the United States, but\ncannot guarantee that we will be able to enter into and maintain any marketing, distribution or third-party\nlogistics agreements with third-party providers on acceptable terms, if at all. We may not be able to correctly\njudge the size and experience of the sales and marketing force and the scale of distribution capabilities\nnecessary to successfully market and sell any new products. Establishing and maintaining sales, marketing and\ndistribution capabilities are expensive and time-consuming. Competition for personnel with experience in\nsales and marketing can be high. Our expenses associated with building and maintaining the sales force and\ndistribution capabilities may be disproportional compared to the revenues we may be able to generate on sales\nof our products.\nWe are working to establish and maintain sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for OPZELURA\nthat will generally be separate from our existing capabilities for oncology indications, and we have no prior\nexperience in commercializing products for dermatology indications. Successful commercialization of our\ndrug candidates for dermatology indications requires us to establish new physician and payor relationships,\nPBM and pharmacy network relationships, reimbursement strategies and governmental interactions. Our\ninability to commercialize successfully products in indications outside of oncology could harm our business\nand operating results.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could lose our approval to market our products or be\nsubject to other governmental enforcement activity.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain regulatory approval to market our products in the\njurisdictions in which they are currently marketed. If we do not maintain our regulatory approval to market\nour products, in particular JAKAFI, our results of operations will be materially harmed. We and our\ncollaborators, third-party manufacturers and suppliers are subject to rigorous and extensive regulation by the\nFDA and other federal and state agencies as well as foreign governmental agencies. These regulations continue\nto apply after product marketing approval, and cover, among other things, testing, manufacturing, quality\ncontrol and assurance, labeling, advertising, promotion, risk mitigation, and adverse event reporting\nrequirements.\nThe commercialization of our products is subject to post-regulatory approval product surveillance, and\nour products may have to be withdrawn from the market or subject to restrictions if previously unknown\nproblems occur. Regulatory agencies may also require additional clinical trials or testing for our products, and\nour products may be recalled or may be subject to reformulation, additional studies, changes in labeling,\nwarnings to the public and negative publicity. For example, from late 2013 through 2014, ICLUSIG was\nsubject to review by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, of the benefits and risks of ICLUSIG to\nbetter understand the nature, frequency and severity of events obstructing the arteries or veins, the potential\nmechanism that leads to these side effects and whether there needed to be a revision in the dosing\nrecommendation, patient monitoring and a risk management plan for ICLUSIG. This review was completed\nin January 2015, with additional warnings in the product information but without any change in the approved\nindications. The EMA could take additional actions in the future that reduce the commercial potential of\nICLUSIG. In addition, in September 2021, the FDA approved a labeling update for JAKAFI, adding warnings\nof increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, thrombosis, and secondary malignancies related to\nanother JAK-inhibitor treating rheumatoid arthritis, a condition for which JAKAFI is not indicated. As part\nof the FDA labeling update for oral JAK inhibitors in treating inflammatory conditions, class “boxed”\nwarnings were also included in the OPZELURA label. We cannot predict the effects on sales of JAKAFI with\nthe updated warnings or OPZELURA as a result of the “boxed” warnings, but it is possible that future sales\n39"

Side effects and other\nproblems experienced by patients from the use of our products could:\n• lessen the frequency with which physicians decide to prescribe our products;\n• encourage physicians to stop prescribing our products to their patients who previously had been\nprescribed our products;\n• cause serious harm to patients that may give rise to product liability claims against us; and\n• result in our need to withdraw or recall our products from the marketplace.\nIf our products are used by a wide patient population, new risks and side effects may be discovered, the\nrate of known risks or side effects may increase, and risks previously viewed as less significant could be\ndetermined to be significant.\nPreviously unknown risks and adverse effects of our products may also be discovered in connection with\nunapproved, or off-label, uses of our products. We are prohibited by law from promoting or in any way\nsupporting or encouraging the promotion of our products for off-label uses, but physicians are permitted to\nuse products for off-label purposes. In addition, we are studying and expect to continue to study JAKAFI in\ndiseases for potential additional indications in controlled clinical settings, and independent investigators are\ndoing so as well. In the event of any new risks or adverse effects discovered as new patients are treated for\nintermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis, uncontrolled polycythemia vera or acute graft-versus-host disease\nand as JAKAFI is studied in or used by patients for off-label indications, regulatory authorities may delay or\nrevoke their approvals, we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials, make changes in labeling of\nJAKAFI, reformulate JAKAFI or make changes and obtain new approvals. We may also experience a\nsignificant drop in the sales of JAKAFI, experience harm to our reputation and the reputation of JAKAFI in\nthe marketplace or become subject to lawsuits, including class actions. Any of these results could decrease or\nprevent sales of JAKAFI or substantially increase the costs and expenses of commercializing JAKAFI. Similar\nresults could occur with respect to our commercialization of ICLUSIG, PEMAZYRE, MONJUVI/MINJUVI\nand OPZELURA.\nPatients who have been enrolled in our clinical trials or who may use our products in the future often have\nsevere and advanced stages of disease and known as well as unknown significant pre-existing and potentially\n40"

Such events could subject us to costly\nlitigation, require us to pay substantial amounts of money to injured patients, delay, negatively impact or end\nour opportunity to receive or maintain regulatory approval to market our products, or require us to suspend\nor abandon our commercialization efforts. Even in a circumstance in which we do not believe that an adverse\nevent is related to our products, the investigation into the circumstance may be time consuming or inconclusive.\nThese investigations may interrupt our sales efforts, impact and limit the type of regulatory approvals our\nproducts receive or maintain, or delay the regulatory approval process in other countries.\nFactors similar to those listed above also apply to our collaborator Novartis for jurisdictions in which it\nhas development and commercialization rights, to ICLUSIG for jurisdictions outside the United States, to our\ncollaborator Lilly for all jurisdictions and to our collaborator Innovent for PEMAZYRE in the jurisdictions\nin which it has development and commercialization rights.\nIf we market our products in a manner that violates various laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil or\ncriminal penalties.\nIn addition to FDA and related regulatory requirements, we are subject to health care “fraud and abuse”\nlaws, such as the federal False Claims Act, the anti-kickback provisions of the federal Social Security Act, and\nother state and federal laws and regulations. Federal and state anti-kickback laws prohibit, among other things,\nknowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for\npurchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any health care item or service\nreimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally- or state-financed health care programs. Federal\nfalse claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for\npayment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a\nfalse claim paid. Pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under these laws for a variety of alleged\npromotional and marketing activities.\nAlthough physicians are permitted, based on their medical judgment, to prescribe products for indications\nother than those approved by the FDA, manufacturers are prohibited from promoting their products for such\noff-label uses. We market JAKAFI for intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis, uncontrolled polycythemia\nvera and acute graft-versus-host disease and provide promotional materials to physicians regarding the use of\nJAKAFI for these indications. Although we believe that our promotional materials for physicians do not\nconstitute improper promotion of JAKAFI, the FDA or other agencies may disagree. If the FDA or another\nagency determines that our promotional materials or other activities constitute improper promotion of\nJAKAFI, it could request that we modify our promotional materials or other activities or subject us to\nregulatory enforcement actions, including the issuance of a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine and\ncriminal penalties. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take\naction if they believe that the alleged improper promotion led to the submission and payment of claims for an\nunapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as\nlaws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement. Even if it is later determined we are not in violation of these\nlaws, we may be faced with negative publicity, incur significant expenses defending our position and have to\ndivert significant management resources from other matters. Similar risks exist for our marketing of\nPEMAZYRE and OPZELURA and our collaborator MorphoSys’s marketing of MONJUVI.\nThe European Union and member countries, as well as governmental authorities in other countries,\nimpose similar strict restrictions on the promotion and marketing of drug products. The off-label promotion\nof medicinal products is prohibited in the EU and in other territories, and the EU also maintains strict controls\non advertising and promotional materials. The promotion of medicinal products that are not subject to a\nmarketing authorization is also prohibited in the EU. Violations of the rules governing the promotion of\nmedicinal products in the EU and in other territories could be penalized by administrative measures, fines and\nimprisonment.\nThe majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false\nclaims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in\nseveral states, apply regardless of the payor.

The Sunshine provisions and similar laws and regulations\nin other jurisdictions where we do business require manufacturers to publicly report certain payments or other\ntransfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals. Many of these requirements are new and\nuncertain, and the penalties for failure to comply with these requirements are unclear. Nonetheless, if we are\nfound not to be in full compliance with these laws, we could face enforcement action and fines and other\npenalties, which could be significant in amount or result in exclusion from federal healthcare programs such as\nMedicare and Medicaid. Any action initiated against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully\ndefend against it, could require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which\ncould harm our business and operating results, and any settlement of such action initiated against us,\nregardless of the merits, could result in the payment of significant amounts, which could harm our financial\ncondition and operating results.

Any products that we develop may be commercialized in competitive markets, and our\ncompetitors, which include large global pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies and smaller\nresearch-based biotechnology companies, may succeed in developing products that render our products\nobsolete\nor\nnoncompetitive.\nMany\nof\nour\ncompetitors,\nparticularly\nlarge\npharmaceutical\nand\nbiopharmaceutical companies, have substantially greater financial, operational and human resources than we\ndo. Smaller or earlier stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through\nfocused development programs and collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. In addition,\nmany of our competitors deploy more personnel to market and sell their products than we do, and we compete\nwith other companies to recruit, hire, train and retain pharmaceutical sales and marketing personnel. If our\nsales force and sales support organization are not appropriately resourced and sized to adequately promote\nour products, the commercial potential of our current and any future products may be diminished. In any\nevent, the commercial potential of our current products and any future products may be reduced or eliminated\nif our competitors develop or acquire and commercialize generic or branded products that are safer or more\neffective, are more convenient or are less expensive than our products. See “Item 1. Business — Competition”\nin this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the effects of competition. If we are\nunable to compete successfully, our commercial opportunities will be reduced and our business, results of\noperations and financial conditions may be materially harmed.\nPresent and potential competitors for JAKAFI include major pharmaceutical and biotechnology\ncompanies, as well as specialty pharmaceutical firms. In addition, JAKAFI could face competition from\ngeneric products. As a result of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984,\ncommonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, in the United States, generic manufacturers may seek approval\nof a generic version of an innovative pharmaceutical by filing with the FDA an Abbreviated New Drug\nApplication, or ANDA. The Hatch-Waxman Act provides significant incentives to generic manufacturers to\nchallenge U.S. patents on successful innovative pharmaceutical products. In February 2016, we received a\nnotice letter regarding an ANDA that requested approval to market a generic version of JAKAFI and\npurported to challenge patents covering ruxolitinib phosphate and its use that expire in 2028. The notice letter\ndoes not challenge the ruxolitinib composition of matter patent, which expires in December 2027. To date, to\nour knowledge, the FDA has taken no action with respect to this ANDA. Separately, in January 2018 the\nPatent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) of United States Patent and Trademark Office denied a petition\nchallenging our patent covering deuterated ruxolitinib analogs and the PTAB subsequently denied the\npetitioner’s request for rehearing in May 2018. Nevertheless, the petitioner still has the right separately to\nchallenge the validity of our patent in federal court. There can be no assurance that our patents will be upheld\nor that any litigation in which we might engage with any such generic manufacturer would be successful in\nprotecting JAKAFI’s exclusivity. The entry of a competitive drug product from another company or a generic\nversion of JAKAFI could result in a decrease in JAKAFI sales and materially harm our business, operating\nresults and financial condition.\n42"

The\nextent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken to limit COVID-19’s spread impact our\noperations and those of our suppliers, collaborators, service providers and healthcare organizations serving\npatients, as well as demand for our drug products, will depend on future developments, which are highly\nuncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the outbreak and any future\nresurgence of the outbreak, additional or modified government actions, including any further restrictions or\nreopening of local, state or national social or economic activity, new information that may emerge concerning\nthe severity of COVID-19 and the actions taken to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced and may in the future experience disruptions\nthat could severely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition, including the following:\n• When the COVID-19 pandemic commenced, to protect the health of our employees and their families,\nand our communities, in accordance with — and in some cases in advance of — direction from state\nand local government authorities, we limited access to our facilities and a significant percentage of our\npersonnel worked remotely. In the event that governmental authorities were to re-establish workplace\nrestrictions, our employees conducting research and development activities may not be able to access\nour laboratory space or access may be limited, and our research and development activities may be\nsignificantly limited or curtailed, possibly for an extended period of time. These research and\ndevelopment activities could include completing Investigational New Drug (IND)/Clinical Trial\nApplication (CTA)-enabling studies, our ability to select future development candidates, and initiation\nof additional clinical trials for our development programs. Having a significant portion of our\nemployees work from home can strain our information technology infrastructure, which may affect\nour ability to operate effectively, may make us more susceptible to communications disruptions, and\nexpose us to greater cybersecurity risks.\n43"

      "text": "• Our sales and marketing activities, including our interactions with healthcare professionals, have been\nlimited and made more difficult by government or employer imposed work from home orders and\ntravel and workplace visitor restrictions resulting from measures to address the COVID-19 pandemic,\nas well as employee-initiated remote work and travel limitations resulting from, among other things,\nthe spread of the COVID-19 variants. In addition, demand for our products has been affected by\ndecreases in new patients, which we believe resulted in large part from decreases in patient visits to\nhealthcare professionals and prioritization of hospital resources for the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting\nin decreases in disease screening and diagnosis. We cannot predict the effects on patient demand or\nfuture sales if there are prolonged quarantines, work from home orders, travel restrictions or surges in\nCOVID-19 cases.\n• Our clinical trials have been and will likely continue to be affected by delays in site initiation, patient\nscreening, patient enrollment, and monitoring and data collection as a result of prioritization of\nhospital resources for the COVID-19 pandemic, difficulty in recruiting and retaining healthcare\nproviders and staff due to their diversion toward treating COVID-19 patients, the potential\nunwillingness of patients to enroll or continue in clinical trials for fear of exposure to COVID-19 at\nsites, and the inability to access sites for initiation and monitoring. In addition, some patients may be\nunable to comply with clinical trial protocols if quarantines or travel restrictions impede patient\nmovement or interrupt health services, we may be unable to obtain blood samples for testing, and we\nmay not be able to provide the trial drug candidate to patients. Also, we rely on independent clinical\ninvestigators, contract research organizations and other third-party service providers to assist us in\nmanaging, monitoring and otherwise carrying out our preclinical studies and clinical trials, and the\nCOVID-19 pandemic has affected and may continue to affect their ability to devote sufficient time and\nresources to our programs or to travel to sites to perform work for us.\n• Regulatory agencies globally have experienced disruptions in their operations as a result of the\ncoronavirus pandemic. The FDA and comparable foreign regulatory agencies may have slower response\ntimes or be under-resourced to continue to monitor our clinical trials and, as a result, review, inspection,\nand other timelines may be materially delayed. If any of these disruptions occur or continue to occur,\nwe cannot predict how long they may last. Our drug candidate application reviews and potential\napprovals could be impacted or delayed by these disruptions, if they occur or continue to occur.\n• The outbreak and measures taken to limit the spread of the outbreak, especially if prolonged, could\nalso disrupt our supply chain or limit our ability to obtain sufficient materials for our drug products\nand product candidates, which could adversely affect our revenues and clinical trial timelines. Currently,\nour supply chain for our drug products and product candidates depends on operations by us and by\nother companies in multiple countries around the world, and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic\non any or all of these countries is uncertain and unpredictable and potential disruption is possible. In\naddition, our third-party manufacturers might experience capacity constraints and delays in producing\nmaterials for our drug products and product candidates if they are required, under the U.S. Defense\nProduction Act or similar governmental mandates, to prioritize production of raw materials, supplies,\ndrugs or vaccines to address COVID-19. And, for JAKAFI, while our strategy is to maintain a\n24 month stock of active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, inclusive of finished product, ruxolitinib\nphosphate might be used by us either to make JAKAFI or for ruxolitinib drug candidates in clinical\ntrials.\n• Any deterioration of worldwide credit and financial markets could result in losses on our holdings of\ncash and investments due to failures of financial institutions and other parties, and interruptions and\ndelays in our ability to collect, or potential losses on, our accounts receivable.\nOur collaborators could be affected by similar factors as those that have or could affect our business. The\nultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to\nchange. We do not yet know the full extent of potential impacts or delays on our or our collaborators’\nbusinesses, our revenues, including milestone and royalty revenues from our collaborators, our and our\ncollaborators’ clinical trials, healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole.

Our\nability to discover and develop drug candidates and to commercialize additional drug products and indications\nwill depend on our ability to:\n• hire and retain key employees;\n• identify high quality therapeutic targets;\n• identify potential drug candidates;\n• develop products internally or license or acquire drug candidates from others;\n• identify and enroll suitable human subjects, either in the United States or abroad, for our clinical trials;\n• complete laboratory testing;\n• commence, conduct and complete safe and effective clinical trials on humans;\n• obtain and maintain necessary intellectual property rights to our products;\n• obtain and maintain necessary regulatory approvals for our products, both in the United States and\nabroad;\n• enter into arrangements with third parties to provide services or to manufacture our products on our\nbehalf;\n• deploy sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing resources effectively or enter into\narrangements with third parties to provide these functions in compliance with all applicable laws;\n• obtain appropriate coverage and reimbursement levels for the cost of our products from governmental\nauthorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors;\n• lease facilities at reasonable rates to support our growth; and\n• enter into arrangements with third parties to license and commercialize our products.\nWe may not be successful in discovering, developing, or commercializing additional drug products or our\nexisting drug products in new indications. Discovery and development of drug candidates are expensive,\nuncertain and time-consuming, and we do not know if our efforts will lead to discovery of any drug candidates\nthat can be successfully developed and marketed. Of the compounds or biologics that we identify as potential\ndrug products or that we may in-license from other companies, including potential products for which we are\nconducting clinical trials, only a few, if any, are likely to lead to successful drug development programs and\ncommercialized drug products.\nWe depend heavily on the success of our most advanced drug candidates. We and our collaborators might not be\nable to commercialize any of our or their drug candidates successfully, and we may spend significant time and\nmoney attempting to do so.\nWe have invested significant resources in the development of our most advanced drug candidates. We\nhave a number of drug candidates in Phase III clinical trials as monotherapies or in combination with other\ndrugs and drug candidates, including parsaclisib, pemigatinib, retifanlimab, ruxolitinib, ruxolitinib cream and\ntafasitamab. Our ability to generate product revenues will depend on the successful development and eventual\ncommercialization of our most advanced drug candidates. We, or our collaborators or licensees, may decide to\ndiscontinue development of any or all of our drug candidates at any time for commercial, scientific or other\nreasons. For example, in April 2018, we along with Merck stopped the ECHO-301 study with epacadostat,\nand we also significantly downsized the epacadostat development program. If a product is developed but not\napproved or marketed, or becomes approved for a narrower set of indications than those for which we initially\nconducted clinical trials, we may have spent significant amounts of time and money on it without achieving\npotential returns initially anticipated, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial\ncondition as well as our business plans.\n45"

      "text": "If we or our collaborators are unable to obtain regulatory approval for our drug candidates in the United States\nand foreign jurisdictions, we or our collaborators will not be permitted to commercialize products resulting from\nour research.\nIn order to commercialize drug products in the United States, drug candidates will have to obtain\nregulatory approval from the FDA. Satisfaction of regulatory requirements typically takes many years. To\nobtain regulatory approval, we or our collaborators, as the case may be, must first show that our or our\ncollaborators’ drug candidates are safe and effective for target indications through preclinical testing (animal\ntesting) and clinical trials (human testing). Preclinical testing and clinical development are long, expensive and\nuncertain processes, and we do not know whether the FDA will allow us or our collaborators to undertake\nclinical trials of any drug candidates in addition to our or our collaborators’ compounds currently in clinical\ntrials. If regulatory approval of a product is granted, this approval will be limited to those disease states and\nconditions for which the product is demonstrated through clinical trials to be safe and effective.\nCompletion of clinical trials may take several years and failure may occur at any stage of testing. The\nlength of time required varies substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of the\ndrug candidate. Interim results of a preclinical test or clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results, and\nacceptable results in early clinical trials may not be repeated in later clinical trials. For example, a drug\ncandidate that is successful at the preclinical level may cause harmful or dangerous side effects when tested at\nthe clinical level. Our rate of commencement and completion of clinical trials may be delayed, and existing\nclinical trials with our or our collaborators’ drug candidates may be stopped, due to many potential factors,\nincluding:\n• the high degree of risk and uncertainty associated with drug development;\n• our inability to formulate or manufacture sufficient quantities of materials for use in clinical trials;\n• variability in the number and types of patients available for each study;\n• difficulty in maintaining contact with patients after treatment, resulting in incomplete data;\n• unforeseen safety issues or side effects;\n• poor or unanticipated effectiveness of drug candidates during the clinical trials; or\n• government or regulatory delays.\nData obtained from clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretation, which may delay, limit or\nprevent regulatory approval. Many companies in the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industry,\nincluding our company, have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after achieving\npromising results in earlier clinical trials. In addition, regulatory authorities may refuse or delay approval as a\nresult of other factors, such as changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development and\nregulatory agency review. For example, the FDA has in the past required, and could in the future require, that\nwe or our collaborators conduct additional trials of any of our drug candidates, which would result in delays.\nIn April 2017, we and our collaborator Lilly announced that the FDA had issued a complete response letter\nfor the New Drug Application, or NDA, of OLUMIANT as a once-daily oral medication for the treatment of\nmoderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis. The letter indicated that additional clinical data were needed to\ndetermine the most appropriate doses and to further characterize safety concerns across treatment arms. In\nJune 2018, after a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA approved the 2mg dose of OLUMIANT for the\ntreatment of adults with moderately-to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate\nresponse to one or more tumor necrosis factor inhibitor therapies. The FDA did not at that time approve any\nhigher dose of OLUMIANT and required a warning label in connection with its approval. In addition, in\nJanuary 2022, we announced that we withdrew the NDA seeking approval of parsaclisib for the treatment of\npatients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma.\nThe decision to withdraw the NDA followed discussions with FDA regarding confirmatory clinical trials that\nwe determined cannot be completed within the time period to support the investment.\nCompounds or biologics developed by us or with or by our collaborators and licensees may not prove to\nbe safe and effective in clinical trials and may not meet all of the applicable regulatory requirements needed to\nreceive marketing approval. For example, in January 2016, a Phase II trial that was evaluating ruxolitinib in\ncombination with regorafenib in patients with relapsed or refractory metastatic colorectal cancer and high\n46"

In addition, in February 2016, we made a\ndecision to discontinue our JANUS 1 study, our JANUS 2 study, our other studies of ruxolitinib in colorectal,\nbreast and lung cancer, and our study of INCB39110 in pancreatic cancer after a planned analysis of interim\nefficacy data of JANUS 1 demonstrated that ruxolitinib plus capecitabine did not show a sufficient level of\nefficacy to warrant continuation. Also, in April 2018, we along with Merck announced that the ECHO-301\nstudy had been stopped and we also significantly downsized the epacadostat development program and in\nJanuary 2020 we stopped our Phase III trial of itacitinib for the treatment of acute graft-versus-host-disease.\nIf clinical trials of any of our or our collaborators’ compounds or biologics are stopped for safety, efficacy or\nother reasons or fail to meet their respective endpoints, our overall development plans, business, prospects,\nexpected operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed and the value of our company\ncould be negatively affected.\nEven if any of our applications receives an FDA Fast Track or priority review designation (including\nbased on a priority review voucher, one of which we recently acquired and used in connection with our\nsubmission seeking FDA approval of ruxolitinib cream for atopic dermatitis), these designations may not\nresult in faster review or approval for our product candidate compared to product candidates considered for\napproval under conventional FDA procedures and, in any event, do not assure ultimate approval of our\nproduct candidate by FDA. For example, in June 2021 we were informed by the FDA that the FDA had\nextended by three months the review period for the NDA for ruxolitinib cream for atopic dermatitis. Also, in\nJuly 2021, we announced that the FDA issued a complete response letter for the BLA of retifanlimab for the\ntreatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal, in which the FDA stated it cannot approve the BLA\nand that additional data are needed. In addition, while the FDA had granted orphan drug designation and\nFast Track designation to parsaclisib as a treatment for patients with follicular lymphoma, marginal zone\nlymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma, as discussed above we withdrew our NDA seeking approval for\ntreatment of patients with those lymphomas. The FDA has recently increased its attention on mandated\nconfirmatory trials for oncology drug candidates with accelerated approvals, and the logistics, cost and timing\nrequired for confirmatory trials may conflict with the investment thesis for drug candidates, resulting in\nwithdrawal of approval applications.\nOutside the United States, our and our collaborators’ ability to market a product is contingent upon\nreceiving a marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities. This foreign regulatory\napproval process typically includes all of the risks associated with the FDA approval process described above\nand may also include additional risks. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product\nlicensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country and may require us to perform\nadditional testing and expend additional resources. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by\nregulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure\napproval by regulatory authorities in other countries or by the FDA.\nHealth care reform measures could impact the pricing and profitability of pharmaceuticals, and adversely affect\nthe commercial viability of our or our collaborators’ products and drug candidates.\nIn recent years, through legislative and regulatory actions and executive orders, the U.S. federal\ngovernment has made substantial changes to various payment systems under the Medicare and other federal\nhealth care programs. Comprehensive reforms to the U.S. healthcare system were enacted, including changes\nto the methods for, and amounts of, Medicare reimbursement. For example, a provision in the American\nRescue Plan Act of 2021 that is expected to be implemented in 2024 will have the effect of increasing the\nMedicaid rebate liability for some medicines that increase prices in excess of inflation. Further, in August 2022,\nthe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was enacted, which includes provisions allowing the federal government\nto negotiate prices for certain high-expenditure single source Medicare drugs, to impose penalties and to\nimplement a potential excise tax for manufacturers that fail to comply with the negotiation by offering a price\nthat is not equal to or less than the negotiated “maximum fair price” under the law, and to impose rebate\nliability on manufacturers that take price increases that exceed inflation. The new law also reduced the\nout-of-pocket prescription drug costs for Medicare Part D beneficiaries, and to help pay for this change in\nbenefit design, the law imposes a new discount program starting in 2025, in which manufacturers pay specified\ndiscounts on Medicare Part D utilization of their drugs as a condition of selling such drugs in the Medicare\nPart D program. The Inflation Reduction Act includes certain exemptions for small biotech drug\n47"

These exemptions apply on a drug-specific basis, and qualifying drugs will be\nexempt from possible negotiation through 2028 and subject to reduced discounts that will be phased-in over a\nnumber of years under the new Part D benefit. While there is currently significant uncertainty regarding the\nimplementation of some of these reforms or the scope of amended or additional reforms, the implementation\nof reforms could significantly reduce net sales resulting from the Medicare programs and limit our ability to\nincrease the prices that we charge for our drugs. Reforms or other changes to these payment systems may\nchange the availability, methods and rates of reimbursements from Medicare, private insurers and other\nthird-party payors for our current and any future approved products. These reforms may affect future\ninvestments in our drug development, should the reforms affect our risk-benefit analysis of investing in a drug\ncandidate. Some of these changes and proposed changes could result in reduced reimbursement rates or the\nelimination of dual sources of payment, which could reduce the price that we or any of our collaborators or\nlicensees receive for any products in the future, and which would adversely affect our business strategy,\noperations and financial results.\nIn addition, there has been an increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with\nrespect to drug pricing practices. This has resulted in significant legislative activity and proposals from the\nprior and current Administrations relating to prescription drug prices and reimbursement, any of which, if\nenacted, could impose downward pressure on the prices that we can charge for our products and may further\nlimit the commercial viability of our products and drug candidates. Specifically, there have been ongoing\nfederal congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation, executive orders and\nadministrative agency rules designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce\ndrug prices, reform government program reimbursement methodologies for prescription drugs, expand access\nto government-mandated discounted pricing (known as 340B pricing) through broader contract pharmacy\narrangements, allow importation of drugs into the United States from other countries, and limit allowable\nprices for drugs through reference to an average price from foreign markets that may be substantially lower\nthan what we currently or would otherwise charge. In certain foreign markets, pricing or profitability of\nprescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control. We expect that the health care reform measures\nthat have been adopted in the United States and in foreign markets, and further reforms that may be adopted\nin the future, could result in more rigorous coverage criteria and additional downward pressure on the prices\nthat we may receive for our approved products. If reimbursement for our products is unavailable or limited in\nscope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business could be materially harmed, including\nby our revenue potentially being materially adversely affected and our research and development efforts\npotentially being materially curtailed or, in some cases, ceasing. There may be future changes that result in\nreductions in current prices, coverage and reimbursement levels for our current or any future approved\nproducts, and we cannot predict the scope of any future changes or the impact that those changes would have\non our operations.\nThe consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the economic effect on government budgets in\nthe United States and elsewhere, may accelerate any of the healthcare reform efforts described above or result\nin future reform efforts, any of which could have adverse effects on our business, including higher costs for us,\nlower reimbursement rates for our products and lower demand for our products.\nFurther, if we become the subject of any governmental or other regulatory hearing or investigation with\nrespect to the pricing of our products or other business practices, we could incur significant expenses and\ncould be distracted from the operation of our business and execution of our business strategy. Any such\nhearing or investigation could also result in significant negative publicity and harm to our reputation, reduced\nmarket acceptance and demand, which could adversely affect our financial results and growth prospects.\nIn addition, the trend toward managed health care in the United States, the organizations for which could\ncontrol or significantly influence the purchase of health care services and products, as well as legislative and\nregulatory proposals to reform health care or address the cost of government insurance programs, may all\nresult in lower prices for or rejection of our products. Adoption of our products by the medical community\nand patients may be limited without adequate reimbursement for those products. Cost control initiatives may\ndecrease coverage and payment levels for our products and, in turn, the price that we will be able to charge for\nany product. Our products may not be considered cost-effective, and coverage and reimbursement may not be\navailable or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. We are unable to predict all changes\nto the coverage or reimbursement methodologies that will be applied by private or government payors to our\ncurrent and any future approved products.\n48"

The same risks apply to our compounds developed and marketed by\nour collaborators, and our future potential milestone and royalty revenues could be affected in a similar\nmanner.\nWe depend on our collaborators and licensees for the future development and commercialization of some of our\ndrug candidates. Conflicts may arise between our collaborators and licensees and us, or our collaborators and\nlicensees may choose to terminate their agreements with us, which may adversely affect our business.\nWe have licensed to Novartis rights to ruxolitinib outside of the United States and worldwide rights to\nour MET inhibitor compounds, including TABRECTA, and licensed to Lilly worldwide rights to baricitinib.\nIn addition, we have licensed to CMS, Innovent, InnoCare and Maruho certain Asian rights to some of our\ndrug products and clinical stage compounds. Under the terms of our agreements with these collaborators, we\nhave no or limited control over the further clinical development of these drug candidates in the relevant\nterritories and any revenues we may receive if these drug candidates receive regulatory approval and are\ncommercialized in the relevant territories will depend primarily on the development and commercialization\nefforts of others. While OLUMIANT was approved by the European Commission in February 2017 for the\ntreatment of moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients and by Japan’s Ministry of Health,\nLabor and Welfare in July 2017 for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in patients with inadequate response\nto standard-of-care therapies, the NDA for OLUMIANT for the treatment of moderate-to-severe rheumatoid\narthritis was approved in June 2018, and only in the lower dosage tablet and with a warning label. Delays in\nany marketing approval by the FDA, European or other regulatory authorities, or any label modifications or\nrestrictions in connection with any such approval, or the existence of other risks relating to approved drug\nproducts, including those described under “Risks Relating to Commercialization of Our Products,” could\ndelay the receipt of and reduce resulting potential royalty and milestone revenue from baricitinib or any of our\nother out-licensed drug candidates.\nConflicts may arise with our collaborators and licensees if they pursue alternative technologies or develop\nalternative products either on their own or in collaboration with others as a means for developing treatments\nfor the diseases that we have targeted. Competing products and product opportunities may lead our\ncollaborators and licensees to withdraw their support for our drug candidates. Any failure of our collaborators\nand licensees to perform their obligations under our agreements with them or otherwise to support our drug\ncandidates could negatively impact the development of our drug candidates, lead to our loss of potential\nrevenues from product sales and milestones and delay our achievement, if any, of profitability. Additionally,\nconflicts have from time to time occurred, and may in the future arise, relating to, among other things, disputes\nabout the achievement and payment of milestone amounts and royalties owed, the ownership of intellectual\nproperty that is developed during the course of a collaborative relationship or the operation or interpretation\nof other provisions in our collaboration agreements. These disputes have led and could in the future lead to\nlitigation or arbitration, which could be costly and divert the efforts of our management and scientific staff,\nand could diminish the expected effectiveness of the collaboration.\nOur existing collaborative and license agreements can be terminated by our collaborators and licensees\nfor convenience, among other circumstances. If any of our collaborators or licensees terminates its agreement\nwith us, or terminates its rights with respect to certain indications or drug candidates, we may not be able to\nfind a new collaborator for them, and our business could be adversely affected. Should an agreement be\nterminated before we have realized the benefits of the collaboration or license, our reputation could be harmed,\nwe may not obtain revenues that we anticipated receiving, and our business could be adversely affected.\nThe success of our drug discovery and development efforts may depend on our ability to find suitable collaborators\nto fully exploit our capabilities. If we are unable to establish collaborations or if these future collaborations are\nunsuccessful in the development and commercialization of our drug candidates, our research, development and\ncommercialization efforts may be unsuccessful, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial\ncondition and future revenue prospects.\nAn element of our business strategy is to enter into collaborative or license arrangements with other\nparties, under which we license our drug candidates to those parties for development and commercialization\n49"

For\nexample, in addition to our Novartis, Lilly, Innovent, InnoCare, Maruho and CMS collaborations, we are\nevaluating strategic relationships with respect to several of our other programs. However, because\ncollaboration and license arrangements are complex to negotiate, we may not be successful in our attempts to\nestablish these arrangements. Also, we may not have drug candidates that are desirable to other parties, or we\nmay be unwilling to license a drug candidate to a particular party because such party interested in it is a\ncompetitor or for other reasons. The terms of any such arrangements that we establish may not be favorable to\nus. Alternatively, potential collaborators may decide against entering into an agreement with us because of\nour financial, regulatory or intellectual property position or for scientific, commercial or other reasons. If we\nare not able to establish collaboration or license arrangements, we may not be able to develop and\ncommercialize a drug product, which could adversely affect our business, our revenues and our future revenue\nprospects.\nWe will likely not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators or licensees\ndevote to our programs or drug candidates. If our collaborators or licensees prove difficult to work with, are\nless skilled than we originally expected, do not devote adequate resources to the program, are unable to obtain\nregulatory approval of our drug candidates, pursue alternative technologies or develop alternative products,\nor do not agree with our approach to development or manufacturing of the drug candidate, the relationship\ncould be unsuccessful. Our collaborations with respect to epacadostat involved the study of our collaborators’\ndrugs used in combination with epacadostat on a number of indications or tumor types, many of which were\nthe same across multiple collaborations. We cannot assure you that potential conflicts will not arise or be\nalleged among these or future collaborations. If a business combination involving a collaborator or licensee\nand a third-party were to occur, the effect could be to terminate or cause delays in development of a drug\ncandidate.\nIf we fail to enter into additional licensing agreements or if these arrangements are unsuccessful, our business and\noperations might be adversely affected.\nIn addition to establishing collaborative or license arrangements under which other parties license our\ndrug candidates for development and commercialization or under which we study our drug candidates in\ncombination with such parties’ compounds or biologics, we may explore opportunities to develop our clinical\npipeline by in-licensing drug candidates or therapeutics targets that fit within our focus on oncology, such as\nour collaborations with Agenus Inc., MacroGenics, Inc., Merus N.V., MorphoSys, Syros Pharmaceuticals,\nInc., and Syndax Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or explore additional opportunities to further develop and\ncommercialize existing drug candidates in specific jurisdictions, such as our June 2016 acquisition of the\ndevelopment and commercialization rights to ICLUSIG in certain countries. We may be unable to enter into\nany additional in-licensing agreements because suitable drug candidates that are within our expertise may not\nbe available to us on terms that are acceptable to us or because competitors with greater resources seek to\nin-license the same drug candidates. Drug candidates that we would like to develop or commercialize may not\nbe available to us because they are controlled by competitors who are unwilling to license the rights to the drug\ncandidate to us. In addition, we may enter into license agreements that are unsuccessful and our business and\noperations might be adversely affected if we are unable to realize the expected economic benefits of a\ncollaboration or other licensing arrangement, by the termination of a drug candidate and termination and\nwinding down of the related license agreement, or due to other business or regulatory issues, including financial\ndifficulties, that may adversely affect a licensor’s ability to continue to perform its obligations under an in-\nlicense agreement. For example, in January 2022, we decided to opt-out of the continued development with\nMerus of MCLA-145, which was the most advanced compound under our collaboration with Merus, and in\nSeptember 2022, we decided to terminate our collaboration with Calithera Biosciences, Inc. If we make or\nincur contractual obligations to make significant upfront payments in connection with licenses for late-stage\ndrug candidates, as we did in March 2020 in connection with the effectiveness of our collaboration agreement\nwith MorphoSys, and if any of those drug candidates do not receive marketing approval or commercial sales\nas anticipated or we have to fund additional clinical trials before marketing approval can be obtained, we will\nhave expended significant funds that might otherwise be applied for other uses or have to expend funds that\nwere not otherwise budgeted or anticipated in connection with the collaboration, and such developments\ncould have a material adverse effect on our stock price and our ability to pursue other transactions.

We may also need to\nlicense drug delivery or other technology in order to continue to develop our drug candidates. If we are unable\nto enter into additional agreements to license drug candidates, drug delivery technology or other technology\nor if these arrangements are unsuccessful, our research and development efforts could be adversely affected,\nand we may be unable to increase our number of successfully marketed products and our revenues.\nEven if a drug candidate that we develop receives regulatory approval, we may decide not to commercialize it if we\ndetermine that commercialization of that product would require more money and time than we are willing to\ninvest.\nEven if any of our drug candidates receives regulatory approval, it could be subject to post-regulatory\nsurveillance, and may have to be withdrawn from the market or subject to restrictions if previously unknown\nproblems occur. Regulatory agencies may also require additional clinical trials or testing, and the drug product\nmay be recalled or may be subject to reformulation, additional studies, changes in labeling, warnings to the\npublic and negative publicity. As a result, we may not continue to commercialize a product even though it has\nobtained regulatory approval. Further, we may decide not to continue to commercialize a product if the market\ndoes not accept the product because it is too expensive or because third parties such as insurance companies\nor Medicare, will not cover it for substantial reimbursement. In addition, we may decide not to continue to\ncommercialize a product if competitors develop and commercialize similar or superior products or have\nproprietary rights that preclude us from ultimately marketing our products.\nAny approved drug product that we bring to the market may not gain market acceptance by physicians, patients,\nhealthcare payors and others in the medical community.\nEven if we or our collaborators are successful in gaining regulatory approval of any of our or our\ncollaborators’ drug candidates in addition to JAKAFI, OLUMIANT, PEMAZYRE, MONJUVI/MINJUVI\nand OPZELURA or acquire rights to approved drug products in addition to ICLUSIG, we may not generate\nsignificant product revenues if these drug products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance.

As part\nof our development strategy, we often hire contract research organizations, or CROs, to perform preclinical\ntesting and clinical trials for drug candidates. If the CROs that we hire to perform our preclinical testing and\nclinical trials do not meet deadlines, do not follow proper procedures, or a conflict arises between us and our\nCROs, our preclinical testing and clinical trials may take longer than expected, may cost more, may be delayed\nor may be terminated. If we were forced to find a replacement entity to perform any of our preclinical testing\nor clinical trials, we may not be able to find a suitable entity on favorable terms, or at all. Even if we were able\nto find another company to perform a preclinical test or clinical trial, the delay in the test or trial may result in\nsignificant additional expenditures. Events such as these may result in delays in our obtaining regulatory\napproval for our drug candidates or our ability to commercialize our products and could result in increased\nexpenditures that would adversely affect our operating results.\nWe face significant competition for our drug discovery and development efforts, and if we do not compete\neffectively, our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and\nsignificant technological change.

As a result of these resources, our competitors may develop drug products that render our\nproducts obsolete or noncompetitive by developing more effective drugs, developing their products more\nefficiently or pricing their products more competitively. Our ability to develop competitive products would be\nlimited if our competitors succeeded in obtaining regulatory approvals for drug candidates more rapidly than\nwe were able to or in obtaining patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limited our drug\ndevelopment efforts. Any drug products resulting from our research and development efforts, or from our\njoint efforts with collaborators or licensees, might not be able to compete successfully with our competitors’\nexisting and future products, or obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere. The development\nof products or processes by our competitors with significant advantages over those that we are developing\ncould harm our future revenues and profitability.\nOur reliance on other parties to manufacture our drug products and drug candidates could result in a short supply\nof the drugs, delays in clinical trials or drug development, increased costs, and withdrawal or denial of a regulatory\nauthority’s approval.\nWe do not currently operate manufacturing facilities for clinical or commercial production of JAKAFI,\nPEMAZYRE, OPZELURA and most of our other drug candidates or for ICLUSIG. We currently hire third\nparties to manufacture the raw materials, API and finished drug product of JAKAFI, ICLUSIG,\nPEMAZYRE, OPZELURA and our other drug candidates for clinical trials and our collaborator MorphoSys\nis currently responsible for sourcing manufacturing of MONJUVI/MINJUVI. In addition, we expect to\ncontinue to rely on third parties for the manufacture of commercial supplies of raw materials, API and finished\ndrug product for any drugs that we successfully develop.

Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products often encounter difficulties in\nproduction, especially in scaling up initial production to commercial quantities from clinical quantities. These\nproblems include difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control and assurance and shortages of\nqualified personnel.

Any such recall could also harm our sales efforts and our reputation. To the extent our supply chain\ninvolves parties in China or materials originating in areas of China that are or could be affected by disease\noutbreaks such as the COVID-19 pandemic or geopolitical events such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine, we\ncould see disruptions to our supply chain.

We generally have a single source or a\nlimited number of suppliers that are qualified to supply each of the API and finished product of our drug\nproducts and our other drug candidates and, in the case of JAKAFI, we only have a single source for its raw\nmaterials.

Either we or our collaborators\nhave primary responsibility for manufacturing activities, and we intend to continue to use third-party contract\nmanufacturing organizations for the manufacture of antibodies in conjunction with our manufacturing facility\nin Switzerland, which became accredited by the Swiss Health Authority in June 2022. Manufacturing\nantibodies and products containing antibodies is a more complex process than manufacturing small molecule\ndrugs and subject to additional risks. The process of manufacturing antibodies and products containing\nantibodies is highly susceptible to product loss due to contamination, equipment failure or improper\ninstallation or operation of equipment, vendor or operator error, inconsistency in yields, variability in product\ncharacteristics, and difficulties in scaling up the production process. Even minor deviations from normal\nmanufacturing processes could result in reduced production yields, product defects and other supply\ndisruptions. If microbial, viral or other contaminations are discovered in our product candidates or in the\nmanufacturing facilities in which our product candidates are made, such manufacturing facilities may need to\nbe closed for an extended period of time to investigate and remedy the contamination.

States increasingly\nhave been placing greater restrictions on the marketing practices of healthcare companies and have instituted\npricing disclosure and other requirements for companies selling pharmaceuticals. In addition, pharmaceutical\nand biotechnology companies have been the target of lawsuits and investigations alleging violations of\ngovernment regulations, including claims asserting submission of incorrect pricing information, improper\npromotion of pharmaceutical products, payments intended to influence the referral of federal or state\nhealthcare business, submission of false claims for government reimbursement, antitrust violations, violations\nof the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery or anti-corruption\nlaws, or violations related to environmental matters. There is also enhanced scrutiny of company-sponsored\npatient assistance programs, including insurance premium and co-pay assistance programs and donations to\nthird-party charities that provide such assistance. In December 2018, we received a civil investigative demand\nfrom the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, for documents and information relating to our speaker programs\nand patient assistance programs, including our support of non-profit organizations that provide financial\nassistance to eligible patients and in November 2019, the qui tam complaint underlying the DOJ inquiry was\nunsealed, at which time we learned that a former employee whom we had terminated had made certain\nallegations relating to the programs described above.

In addition to damages, fines and\npenalties for violation of laws and regulations, we could be required to repay amounts we received from\ngovernment payors, or pay additional rebates and interest if we are found to have miscalculated the pricing\ninformation we have submitted to the government.

Our future success also depends in part on the continued service of our executive\nmanagement team and key personnel and our ability to recruit, train and retain essential personnel for our\ndrug discovery and development programs, and for our medical affairs and commercialization activities. If we\nlose the services of any of these people or if we are unable to recruit sufficient qualified personnel, our research\nand product development goals, and our commercialization efforts could be delayed or curtailed. We do not\nmaintain “key person” insurance on any of our employees.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, our ability to develop and commercialize products could suffer.\nWe expect that if our drug discovery efforts continue to generate drug candidates, our clinical drug\ncandidates continue to progress in development, and we continue to build our development, medical and\ncommercial organizations, we will require significant additional investment in personnel, management and\nresources. Our ability to achieve our research, development and commercialization objectives depends on our\nability to respond effectively to these demands and expand our internal organization, systems, controls and\nfacilities to accommodate additional anticipated growth. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively,\nour business could be harmed and our ability to execute our business strategy could suffer.\nWe may acquire businesses or assets, form joint ventures or make investments in other companies that may be\nunsuccessful, divert our management’s attention and harm our operating results and prospects.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may pursue additional acquisitions of what we believe to be\ncomplementary businesses or assets or seek to enter into joint ventures. We also may pursue strategic alliances\nin an effort to leverage our existing infrastructure and industry experience to expand our product offerings or\ndistribution, or make investments in other companies. For example, in June 2016, we completed the acquisition\nof the European operations of ARIAD. The success of our acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic alliances and\ninvestments will depend on our ability to identify, negotiate, complete and, in the case of acquisitions, integrate\nthose transactions and, if necessary, obtain satisfactory debt or equity financing to fund those transactions.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, joint venture, strategic alliance or investment.\nWe may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into our existing business, achieve planned synergies\nor cost savings, maintain the key business relationships of businesses we acquire, or retain key personnel of an\nacquired business, and we could assume unknown or contingent liabilities or incur unanticipated expenses.\nIntegration of acquired companies or businesses also may require management resources that otherwise would\nbe available for ongoing development of our existing business. Any acquisitions or investments made by us\nalso could result in significant write-offs or the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, any of which\ncould harm our operating results. For example, in each of the fiscal quarters in 2022 we recorded unrealized\nlosses related to our investments in our collaboration partners, and we may in experience additional losses\nrelated to our investments in future period. In addition, if we choose to issue shares of our stock as\nconsideration for any acquisition, dilution to our stockholders could result.\nRisks associated with our operations outside of the United States could adversely affect our business.\nOur acquisition of ARIAD’s European operations significantly expanded our operations in Europe, and\nwe plan to continue to expand our operations and conduct certain development activities outside of the United\nStates. For example, as part of our plans to expand our activities outside of the United States, we now conduct\n55"

In addition, we may\ndetermine that we should increase our coverage, and this insurance may be prohibitively expensive to us or our\ncollaborators or licensees and may not fully cover our potential liabilities. Since December 30, 2017, we elected\nto self-insure a portion of our exposure to product liability risks through our wholly-owned captive insurance\nsubsidiary, in tandem with third-party insurance policies. Our inability to obtain sufficient product liability\ninsurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the\ndevelopment or commercialization of our drug candidates and products, and if our liabilities from any such\nclaims exceed our third-party insurance limits and self-insurance reserves, our results of operations, cash\nflows and financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nBecause our activities involve the use of hazardous materials, we may be subject to claims relating to improper\nhandling, storage or disposal of these materials that could be time consuming and costly.\nWe are subject to various environmental, health and safety laws and regulations governing, among other\nthings, the use, handling, storage and disposal of regulated substances and the health and safety of our\nemployees. Our research and development processes involve the controlled use of hazardous and radioactive\nmaterials and biological waste resulting in the production of hazardous waste products. We cannot completely\neliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these materials. If\nany injury or contamination results from our use or the use by our collaborators or licensees of these materials,\nwe may be sued and our liability may exceed our insurance coverage and our total assets. Further, we may be\nrequired to indemnify our collaborators or licensees against all damages and other liabilities arising out of our\ndevelopment activities or products produced in connection with these collaborations or licenses. Compliance\nwith the applicable environmental and workplace laws and regulations is expensive. Future changes to\nenvironmental, health, workplace and safety laws could cause us to incur additional expense or may restrict\nour operations or impair our research, development and production efforts.\nBusiness disruptions could seriously harm our operations, future revenues and financial condition and increase\nour costs and expenses.\nOur operations, and those of our CROs, suppliers, and other contractors and consultants, could be\nsubject to geopolitical events, natural disasters, power and other infrastructure failures or shortages, public\nhealth pandemics or epidemics, and other natural or man-made disasters or business interruptions. In addition,\ngeopolitical and other events, such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine, could lead to sanctions, embargoes,\nsupply shortages, regional instability, geopolitical shifts, cyberattacks, other retaliatory actions, and adverse\neffects on macroeconomic conditions, currency exchange rates, and financial markets, which could adversely\nimpact our operations and financial results, as well as those of third parties with whom we conduct business.\nThe occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm our operations, future revenues and\nfinancial condition and increase our costs and expenses. We have engaged CROs to conduct clinical trials\noutside the United States, including a limited number of trials in Ukraine and Russia. We may not be able to\ncomplete any additional dosing or follow-up visits of patients in Ukraine and Russia who are participating in\nthese clinical trials. We may also be unable to ship additional clinical drug and other supplies necessary to\ncomplete the clinical trials in Ukraine and Russia. Although the impact of Russia’s invasion is highly\nunpredictable, certain clinical trial activities have already been changed or suspended, and may continue to be\nchanged, suspended or terminated, which could potentially increase our costs, slow down our product\ncandidate development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and\ngenerate revenues.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS\nWe may incur losses in the future, and we expect to continue to incur significant expenses to discover and develop\ndrugs, which may make it difficult for us to achieve sustained profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the\nfuture.\nDue to historical net losses, we had an accumulated deficit of $0.4 billion as of December 31, 2022.

To date, we do not have any drug\nproducts that have generated significant revenues other than from sales of JAKAFI and we cannot assure you\nthat we will generate substantial revenues from the drug candidates that we license or develop, including\nICLUSIG, PEMAZYRE, MONJUVI/MINJUVI, and OPZELURA, for several years, if ever.\nWe cannot be certain whether or when we will achieve sustained or increased profitability on a quarterly\nor annual basis because of the factors discussed under “Risks Relating to Commercialization of our Products”\nand in the above paragraphs and the significant uncertainties relating to our ability to generate commercially\nsuccessful drug products. Even if we are successful in obtaining regulatory approvals for manufacturing and\ncommercializing drug products in addition to JAKAFI, ICLUSIG, PEMAZYRE, MONJUVI/MINJUVI,\nand OPZELURA, we may incur losses if our drug products do not generate significant revenues.\nWe may need additional capital in the future.

Such financing, if available, may not be available\non commercially attractive terms.\nAs discussed under “Other Risks Relating to Our Business — We may acquire businesses or assets, form\njoint ventures or make investments in other companies that may be unsuccessful, divert our management’s\nattention and harm our operating results and prospects,” any investments that we may make in companies\nwith which we have strategic alliances, such as Agenus, Merus and MorphoSys, could result in our recognition\nof losses on those investments. In addition, to the extent we may seek to sell or otherwise monetize those\ninvestments, we may not be able to do so at our desired price or valuation levels, or at all, due to the limited\nliquidity of some or all of those investments.\nAny loss in value of our long term investments could adversely affect our financial position on the\nconsolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations.\nChanges in tax laws or regulations could adversely affect our results of operations, business and financial\ncondition.\nNew tax laws or regulations could be enacted at any time, and existing tax laws or regulations could be\ninterpreted, modified or applied in a manner that is adverse to us or our customers, which could adversely\naffect our results of operations, business and financial condition. For example, beginning in 2022, the Tax\nCuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures for tax\npurposes in the year incurred and instead requires taxpayers to capitalize and subsequently amortize such\nexpenditures over five years for research activities conducted in the United States and over 15 years for research\nactivities conducted outside the United States. If the requirement to amortize research and development\nexpenditures is not repealed or otherwise modified, it will continue to have an adverse effect on our tax liability,\nand the amount of that effect could be material. As another example, in August 2022, the Inflation Reduction\nAct of 2022 was enacted, which, among other things, includes a new 15% alternative minimum tax on the\nadjusted financial statement income of certain large corporations for tax years beginning after December 31,\n2022. Furthermore, the enactment of some or all of the recommendations set forth or that may be forthcoming\nin the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) project on “Base Erosion and\nProfit Shifting” (commonly known as BEPS 2.0) by tax authorities and economic blocs in the countries in\nwhich we operate, could unfavorably impact our effective tax rate. Broadly speaking, BEPS 2.0 would make\nfundamental changes to the international tax system, including with respect to the entitlement to tax global\ncorporate profits and minimum global tax rates. For example, in December 2022, the EU member states\nagreed to implement in their domestic tax laws a 15% global minimum tax on the profits of large multinational\nenterprises with a target effective date for fiscal years beginning on or after December 31, 2023. Although we\ncontinue to evaluate and assess the potential impact of the recent U.S. legislation and BEPS 2.0 on us, the\nminimum tax rules could result in tax increases in both the United States and many foreign jurisdictions where\nwe operate or have a presence. Any new tax legislation or initiatives could not only significantly increase our\ntax provision, cash tax liabilities, and effective tax rate, but could also significantly increase tax uncertainty\ndue to differing interpretations and increased audit scrutiny.\n59"

We are aware of patents and patent applications filed in certain countries claiming\nintellectual property relating to some of our drug discovery targets and drug candidates. While the validity of\nissued patents, patentability of pending patent applications and applicability of any of them to our programs\nare uncertain, if any of these patents are asserted against us or if we choose to license any of these patents, our\nability to commercialize our products could be harmed or the potential return to us from any product that\nmay be successfully commercialized could be diminished.\nFrom time to time we have received, and we may in the future receive, notices from third parties offering\nlicenses to technology or alleging patent, trademark, or copyright infringement, claims regarding trade secrets\nor other contract claims. Receipt of these notices could result in significant costs as a result of the diversion of\nthe attention of management from our drug discovery and development efforts. Parties sending these notices\nmay have brought and in the future may bring litigation against us or seek arbitration relating to contract\nclaims.\nWe may be involved in future lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other\nintellectual property rights or contract violations.

Despite our efforts to protect this\ninformation, unauthorized parties may attempt to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.\nFor example, one of our collaborators may disclose proprietary information pertaining to our drug discovery\nefforts. In addition, while we have filed numerous patent applications with respect to ruxolitinib and our drug\ncandidates in the United States and in foreign countries, our patent applications may fail to result in issued\npatents. In addition, because patent applications can take several years to issue as patents, there may be pending\npatent applications of others that may later issue as patents that cover some aspect of ruxolitinib and our drug\ncandidates. Our existing patents and any future patents we may obtain may not be broad enough to protect\nour products or all of the potential uses of our products, or otherwise prevent others from developing\ncompeting products or technologies. In addition, our patents may be challenged and invalidated or may fail to\nprovide us with any competitive advantages if, for example, others were first to invent or first to file a patent\napplication for the technologies and products covered by our patents. As noted above under “— Risks Relating\nto Commercialization of Our Products — Competition for our products could potentially harm our business\nand result in a decrease in our revenue,” a potential generic drug company competitor has challenged certain\npatents relating to JAKAFI.\nAdditionally, when we do not control the prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of certain important\nintellectual property, such as a drug candidate in-licensed to us or subject to a collaboration with a third-party,\nthe protection of the intellectual property rights may not be in our hands. If we do not control the intellectual\nproperty rights in-licensed to us with respect to a drug candidate and the entity that controls the intellectual\nproperty rights does not adequately protect those rights, our rights may be impaired, which may impact our\nability to develop, market and commercialize the in-licensed drug candidate.\nOur means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate, and our competitors may:\n• independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information, products and techniques;\n• otherwise gain access to our proprietary information; or\n• design around patents issued to us or our other intellectual property.\nWe pursue a policy of having our employees, consultants and advisors execute proprietary information\nand invention agreements when they begin working for us. However, these agreements may not provide\nmeaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use\nor disclosure. If we fail to maintain trade secret and patent protection, our potential future revenues may be\ndecreased.\nIf the effective term of our patents is decreased due to changes in the United States patent laws or if we need to\nrefile some of our patent applications, the value of our patent portfolio and the revenues we derive from it may be\ndecreased.\nThe value of our patents depends, in part, on their duration. A shorter period of patent protection could\nlessen the value of our rights under any patents that we obtain and may decrease the revenues we derive from\nour patents. The United States patent laws provide a term of patent protection of 20 years from the earliest\neffective filing date of the patent application. Because the time from filing to issuance of biotechnology\napplications may be more than three years depending on the subject matter, a 20-year patent term from the\nfiling date may result in substantially shorter patent protection.\nAdditionally, United States patent laws were amended in 2011 with the enactment of the America Invents\nAct and third parties are now able to challenge the validity of issued U.S. patents through various review\nproceedings; thus rendering the validity of U.S. patents more uncertain.

If we are unsuccessful in these proceedings some or all of our claims in the patents may be narrowed\nor invalidated and the patent protection for our products and drug candidates in the United States could be\nsubstantially shortened. Further, if all of the patents covering one of our products are invalidated, the FDA\ncould approve requests to manufacture a generic version of that product prior to the expiration date of those\npatents.\nOther changes in the United States patent laws or changes in the interpretation of patent laws could\ndiminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. For example, the Supreme\nCourt of the United States resolved a split among the circuit courts of appeals regarding antitrust challenges\nto settlements of patent infringement lawsuits under the Hatch-Waxman Act between brand-name drug\ncompanies and generic drug companies. The Court rejected the “scope of the patent” test and ruled that\nsettlements involving “reverse payments”from brand-name drug companies to generic drug companies should\nbe analyzed under the rule of reason. This ruling may create uncertainty and make it more difficult to settle\npatent litigation if a company seeking to manufacture a generic version of one of our products challenges the\npatents covering that product prior to the expiration date of those patents.\nInternational patent protection is particularly uncertain and costly, and our involvement in opposition proceedings\nin foreign countries may result in the expenditure of substantial sums and management resources.\nBiotechnology and pharmaceutical patent law outside the United States is even more uncertain and costly\nthan in the United States and is currently undergoing review and revision in many countries. Further, the laws\nof some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as United States\nlaws. For example, certain countries do not grant patent claims that are directed to the treatment of humans.\nWe have participated, and may in the future participate, in opposition proceedings to determine the validity of\nour foreign patents or our competitors’ foreign patents, which could result in substantial costs and diversion\nof our efforts. Successful challenges to our patent or other intellectual property rights through these\nproceedings could result in a loss of rights in the relevant jurisdiction and allow third parties to use our\nproprietary technologies without a license from us or our collaborators, which may also result in loss of future\nroyalty payments. In addition, successful challenges may jeopardize or delay our ability to enter into new\ncollaborations or commercialize potential products, which could harm our business and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATING TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND DATA PRIVACY\nSignificant disruptions of information technology systems, breaches of data security, or unauthorized disclosures\nof sensitive data or personally identifiable information or individually identifiable health information could\nadversely affect our business, and could subject us to liability or reputational damage.\nOur business is increasingly dependent on critical, complex, and interdependent information technology\n(IT) systems, including Internet-based systems, some of which are managed or hosted by third parties, to\nsupport business processes as well as internal and external communications. The size and complexity of our IT\nsystems make us potentially vulnerable to IT system breakdowns, malicious intrusion, and computer viruses,\nwhich may result in the impairment of our ability to operate our business effectively. In addition, having a\nsignificant portion of our employees work remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise can strain\nour information technology infrastructure, which may affect our ability to operate effectively, may make us\nmore susceptible to communications disruptions, and expose us to greater cybersecurity risks.\nWe are continuously evaluating and, where appropriate, enhancing our IT systems to address our planned\ngrowth, including to support our planned manufacturing operations. In particular, we are currently in the\nprocess of implementing a new enterprise resource planning system. There are inherent costs and risks\nassociated with implementing the enhancements to our IT systems, including potential delays in access to, or\nerrors in, critical business and financial information, substantial capital expenditures, additional administrative\ntime and operating expenses, retention of sufficiently skilled personnel to implement and operate the enhanced\nsystems, demands on management time, and costs of delays or difficulties in transitioning to the enhanced\nsystems, any of which could harm our business and results of operations.

Because\nof the rapidly moving nature of technology and the increasing sophistication of cybersecurity threats, our\nmeasures to prevent, respond to and minimize such risks may be unsuccessful.\nIn addition, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union has adopted a\ncomprehensive general data privacy regulation, known as the GDPR, which governs the collection and use of\npersonal data in the European Union. The GDPR, which is wide-ranging in scope, imposes several\nrequirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information\nprovided to the individuals, the security and confidentiality of the personal data, data breach notification and\nthe use of third party processors in connection with the processing of the personal data. The GDPR also\nimposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the European Union to the United States, provides\nan enforcement authority and imposes large penalties for noncompliance, including the potential for fines of\nup to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the infringer, whichever is greater. The United\nKingdom has enacted legislation similar to the GDPR, the UK GDPR, which provides for potential fines of\nup to the greater of £17.5 million or 4% of the annual global revenue. Moreover, the European Court of\nJustice in July 2020 invalidated the Privacy Shield framework that had been in place between the European\nUnion and the United States, which invalidation has created uncertainty about how data can now be shared in\na compliant manner. Additionally, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) affords a private right of\naction to such consumers if certain data breaches result in the loss or theft of their personal information. The\nGDPR, UK GDPR, CCPA and other similar laws or regulations enacted or proposed to be enacted in the\nUnited States or other jurisdictions associated with the enhanced protection of certain types of sensitive data,\nincluding healthcare data or other personal information, may increase our costs of doing business, and the\ndiffering requirements of these laws and regulations can complicate our compliance efforts.\nIncreasing use of social media could give rise to liability, breaches of data security, or reputational damage.\nWe and our employees are increasingly utilizing social media tools as a means of communication both\ninternally and externally. Despite our efforts to monitor evolving social media communication guidelines and\ncomply with applicable rules, there is risk that the use of social media by us or our employees to communicate\nabout our products or business may cause us to be found in violation of applicable requirements. In addition,\nour employees may knowingly or inadvertently make use of social media in ways that may not comply with\nour social media policy or other legal or contractual requirements, which may give rise to liability, lead to the\nloss of trade secrets or other intellectual property, or result in public exposure of personal information of our\nemployees, clinical trial patients, customers, and others. Furthermore, negative posts or comments about us or\nour products in social media could seriously damage our reputation, brand image, and goodwill.\n63"

None of the materials on, or accessible through, these websites are part of this report\nor are incorporated by reference herein.\nOverview\nIncyte is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of\nproprietary therapeutics. Our global headquarters is located in Wilmington, Delaware, where we conduct\nglobal clinical development and commercial operations. We also conduct clinical development and commercial\noperations from our European headquarters in Morges, Switzerland and our other offices across Europe, our\nJapanese office in Tokyo and our Canadian headquarters in Montreal.\nOur portfolio focuses on areas of high unmet medical need and includes compounds in various stages,\nranging from preclinical to late stage development, and commercialized products JAKAFI® (ruxolitinib),\nICLUSIG® (ponatinib), PEMAZYRE® (pemigatinib) and OPZELURA™(ruxolitinib) cream, as well as\nMINJUVI® (tafasitamab) and MONJUVI® (tafasitamab-cxix), which are co-commercialized.\nOur revenues depend on continued sales of our products, and we depend substantially on product\nrevenues from JAKAFI. We must develop and commercialize new products to achieve revenue growth and to\noffset revenue losses from when products lose their exclusivity or when competing products are launched. For\nadditional information, including information on the expirations of patents for various products, see Part I,\nItem 1 of this report, “Business — Patents and Other Intellectual Property” and “Business — Competition.”\nWe devote substantial resources to research and development activities and to acquire rights to new product\ncandidates and technologies, but successful product development in the biopharmaceutical industry is highly\nuncertain.\nOur product revenues also face challenges from economic conditions and drug pricing initiatives driven\nby governments and private payors. See Part I, Item 1A of this report, “Risk Factors” for a further discussion\nof certain factors that could impact our future product revenues.\nEffects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Our Business\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance going forward\ndepends on numerous factors, all of which are difficult to predict.

As a result, it is not\ncurrently possible to ascertain the potential long term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.\nTo date, however, we have not experienced a material effect on the results of our commercial operations,\nor our manufacturing supply chain. New patient starts for treatment decreased as a result of shelter in place\nand other protective measures in the early stages of the pandemic, and if decreases in new patient starts occur\nin future periods, our revenues in future periods could be adversely affected. We continue to anticipate that\nshort-term effects may continue to emerge across different aspects of our global clinical trial programs. For\nexample, while we expect ongoing monitoring of already-enrolled patients to continue, difficulties in\nmonitoring may result as a consequence of any new shelter in place orders and other protective measures\nimplemented by governmental authorities or clinical trial sites. In addition, new patient recruitment in certain\nclinical trials has been and may in the future be impacted, in particular with respect to our earlier stage clinical\ntrials. We also expect the conduct of clinical trials may continue to vary by disease state and by severity of\ndisease, as well as by geography, as some regions are more adversely impacted. Overall, we caution that the\nduration and severity of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic remains uncertain, and we may not yet be able\nto assess its consequences accurately or fully at this time.\nRegulatory Achievements\nIn May 2022, under our collaboration agreement with Novartis International Pharmaceutical Ltd., the\nEuropean Commission (EC) approved JAKAVI (ruxolitinib) for the treatment of patients aged 12 years and\nolder with acute and chronic GVHD and who have inadequate response to corticosteroids or other systemic\ntherapies. JAKAVI is the first Janus kinase (JAK)1/2 inhibitor available for patients with GVHD in Europe.\nIn May 2022, under our collaboration agreement with Eli Lilly and Company, the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA) approved OLUMIANT for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized adults\nrequiring supplemental oxygen, non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane\noxygenation with a recommended dose of 4-mg once daily for 14 days or until hospital discharge, whichever\ncomes first. OLUMIANT is the first and only JAK inhibitor FDA-approved for the treatment of COVID-19\nin certain hospitalized adults requiring various degrees of oxygen support.\nIn June 2022, under our collaboration agreement with Novartis, the EC approved TABRECTA\n(capmatinib) as a monotherapy for the treatment of adults with advanced non-small cell lung cancer NSCLC)\nharboring alterations leading to mesenchymalepithelial-transition factor gene (MET) exon 14 (METex14)\nkipping who require systemic therapy following prior treatment with immunotherapy and/or platinum-based\nchemotherapy.\nIn June 2022, under our collaboration agreement with Lilly, the FDA approved OLUMIANT as the first\nand only systemic treatment for adults with severe alopecia areata (AA). In June 2022, the EC approved\nOLUMIANT as the first and only centrally-authorized treatment for adults with severe AA in Europe. In\nJune 2022, the Japan Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare approved OLUMIANT as a treatment for adults\nwith alopecia areata.\nIn July 2022, the FDA approved OPZELURA (ruxolitinib) cream for the topical treatment of\nnonsegmental vitiligo in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. OPZELURA is the first and\nonly FDA-approved treatment for repigmentation in patients with vitiligo, and the only topical formulation of\na JAK inhibitor approved in the United States.\nIn August 2022, the FDA approved PEMAZYRE for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory\nmyeloid/lymphoid neoplasms (MLNs) with FGFR1 rearrangement. PEMAZYRE is the first and only\ntargeted treatment for MLNs with FGFR1 rearrangement. MLNs with FGFR1 rearrangement are extremely\nrare and aggressive blood cancers that may impact less than 1 in 100,000 people in the United States.\nIn December 2022, the FDA approved a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) for revisions to\nJAKAFI labelling to update the Pediatric Use section of the Prescribing Information to describe the available\nexperience of ruxolitinib in pediatric patients based on data from a study in children with de novo high-risk\nCRLF2-rearranged and/or JAK pathway-mutant acute lymphoblastic leukemia.\n68"

Maruho will receive the rights to develop, manufacture and exclusively\ncommercialize ruxolitinib cream, and other potential future topical formulations of ruxolitinib, in autoimmune\nand inflammatory dermatologic diseases, including vitiligo and atopic dermatitis, in Japan.\nNovartis\nIn April 2022, we recognized a $15.0 million regulatory milestone for the positive opinion issued by the\nCommittee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) that\nrecommended granting marketing authorization for capmatinib (TABRECTA) as a monotherapy for the\ntreatment of adults with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Additionally, in May 2022, we recognized a\n$45.0 million regulatory milestone as a result of the European Commission’s approval of JAKAVI (ruxolitinib)\nas the first post-steroid treatment for acute and chronic GVHD.\nVillaris\nIn November 2022, we acquired Villaris Therapeutics, Inc., an asset-centric biopharmaceutical company\nfocused on the development of novel antibody therapeutics for vitiligo. Its lead asset, auremolimab (VM6), is\nan anti-IL-15Rβ monoclonal antibody (mAb).

On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical\nexperience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results\nof which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not\nreadily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from those estimates under different\nassumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant\njudgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. See Note 1 of Notes\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete list of our significant accounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition.\nWe recognize revenue only when we have satisfied a performance obligation\nthrough transferring control of the promised good or service to a customer in an amount that reflects the\nconsideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. We apply the following five-step\nmodel in order to determine this amount: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract;\n(ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations, including whether\nthey are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the\nconstraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations;\nand (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation, which for the\nCompany is at a point in time. We also assess collectability based primarily on the customer’s payment history\nand on the creditworthiness of the customer.\nProduct Revenues\nOur product revenues consist of sales of JAKAFI, OPZELURA, PEMAZYRE, ICLUSIG, and\nMINJUVI. Product revenues are recognized once we satisfy the performance obligation at a point in time\nunder the revenue recognition criteria as described above. We recognize revenues for product received by our\ncustomers net of allowances for customer credits, including estimated rebates, chargebacks, discounts, returns,\ndistribution service fees, patient assistance programs, and government rebates, such as Medicare Part D\ncoverage gap reimbursements in the United States. These sales allowances and accruals are recorded based on\nestimates which are described in detail below. Estimates are assessed as of the end of each reporting period\nand are updated to reflect current information. We believe that our sales allowances and accruals are reasonable\nand appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. As of December 31, 2022, a 5% change in our sales\nallowance and accruals would have had an approximate $50.1 million impact on our income before taxes.\nCustomer Credits:\nOur customers are offered various forms of consideration, including allowances,\nservice fees and prompt payment discounts. We expect our customers will earn prompt payment discounts\nand, therefore, we deduct the full amount of these discounts from total product sales when revenues are\nrecognized. Service fees are also deducted from total product sales as they are earned.\nRebates and Discounts:\nWe accrue rebates for mandated discounts under the Medicaid Drug Rebate\nProgram in the United States and mandated discounts in Europe in markets where government-sponsored\nhealthcare systems are the primary payers for healthcare. These accruals are based on statutory discount rates\nand expected utilization as well as historical data we have accumulated since product launch. In the fourth\nquarter of 2021 and fiscal year 2022 for non-covered patients of OPZELURA, we offered a full buy-down\nprogram as we were in the process of obtaining commercial insurance coverage for OPZELURA. During\n2022, we contracted with the three largest group purchasing organizations to obtain coverage for\nOPZELURA. All full buy-down programs for OPZELURA ended effective January 31, 2023. Our estimates\nfor expected utilization of commercial insurance rebates are based on data received from our customers.\nRebates are generally invoiced and paid in arrears so that the accrual balance consists of an estimate of the\namount expected to be incurred for the current quarter’s activity, plus an accrual balance for known prior\n70"

      "text": "quarters’ unpaid rebates. If actual future rebates vary from estimates, we may need to adjust prior period\naccruals, which would affect revenue in the period of adjustment.\nChargebacks:\nChargebacks are discounts that occur when certain indirect contracted customers\npurchase directly from our wholesalers at a discounted price. The wholesalers, in turn, charges back to us the\ndifference between the price initially paid by the wholesalers and the discounted price paid by the contracted\ncustomers. In addition to actual chargebacks received, we maintain an accrual for chargebacks based on the\nestimated contractual discounts on the inventory levels on hand in our distribution channel. If actual future\nchargebacks vary from these estimates, we may need to adjust prior period accruals, which would affect revenue\nin the period of adjustment.\nMedicare Part D Coverage Gap:\nMedicare Part D prescription drug benefit mandates manufacturers to\nfund 70% of the Medicare Part D insurance coverage gap for prescription drugs sold to eligible patients. Our\nestimates for the expected Medicare Part D coverage gap are based on historical invoices received and in part\nfrom data received from our customers. Funding of the coverage gap is generally invoiced and paid in arrears\nso that the accrual balance consists of an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current\nquarter’s activity, plus an accrual balance for known prior quarters. If actual future funding varies from\nestimates, we may need to adjust prior period accruals, which would affect revenue in the period of adjustment.\nAdditionally, beginning in January 2020, the amount of spending required by eligible patients in the Medicare\nPart D insurance coverage gap increased 30% due to the expiration of a provision in the Patient Protection\nand Affordable Care Act, which now results in a change in the True Out of Pocket (TrOOP) calculation\nmethodology. The methodological change has resulted in an increase in required spending by patients and, in\nturn, an increase in manufacturers’ contributions on behalf of patients in the Medicare Part D insurance\ncoverage gap.\nCo-payment Assistance:\nPatients who have commercial insurance and meet certain eligibility\nrequirements may receive co-payment assistance. We accrue a liability for co-payment assistance based on\nactual program participation and estimates of program redemption using data provided by third-party\nadministrators. During the fourth quarter of 2021 and fiscal year 2022, we also offered a full buy-down\nprogram to non-covered patients of OPZELURA as we were obtaining commercial insurance coverage for\nOPZELURA. All full buy-down programs for OPZELURA ended effective January 31, 2023.\nProduct Royalty Revenues\nRoyalty revenues on commercial sales for JAKAVI and TABRECTA by Novartis are estimated based on\ninformation provided by Novartis. Royalty revenues on commercial sales for OLUMIANT by Lilly are\nestimated based on information provided by Lilly. Royalty revenues on commercial sales for PEMAZYRE by\nInnovent are estimated based on information provided by Innovent. We recognize royalty revenues in the\nperiod the sales occur. We exercise judgment in determining whether the information provided is sufficiently\nreliable for us to base our royalty revenue recognition thereon. If actual royalties vary from estimates, we may\nneed to adjust the prior period, which would affect royalty revenue and receivable in the period of adjustment.\nHistorically, adjustments to these estimates to reflect actual royalty revenues have not been material to our\nfinancial results and have been less than 1% of royalty revenues.\nMilestone and Contract Revenues\nAt the inception of a contract, we determine the transaction price, in addition to any upfront payment,\nby estimating the amount of variable consideration, including milestone payments, at the outset of the contract\nutilizing the most likely amount method. Our contractual milestones typically relate to the achievement of\npre-specified development, regulatory and commercialization events outside of our control, such as regulatory\napproval of a compound, first patient dosing or achievement of sales-based thresholds. We include milestones\nin the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of\ncumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the milestone is\nsubsequently resolved. Given the high level of uncertainty of achievement, variable consideration associated\nwith milestones are fully constrained until confirmation of the satisfaction or completion of the milestone by\nthe third-party. We review our estimate of the transaction price each period, and make revisions to such\nestimates as necessary.\n71"

      "text": "Stock Compensation.\nShare-based payment transactions with employees, which include stock options,\nrestricted stock units (RSUs) and performance shares (PSUs), are recognized as compensation expense over\nthe requisite service period based on their estimated fair values at the date of grant as well as expected forfeiture\nrates based on actual experience. The stock compensation process requires significant judgment and the use of\nestimates, particularly surrounding Black-Scholes assumptions such as stock price volatility over the option\nterm and expected option lives, as well as expected forfeiture rates and the probability of PSUs vesting. For\nthe years ending December 31, 2022 and 2021, our Black-Scholes assumptions included a weighted-average\nstock price volatility of 36% in 2022 and 39% in 2021, average expected option life of approximately five years\nand an estimated annualized forfeiture rate of 5%. The average risk-free interest rate assumption used in the\nBlack-Scholes valuations increased from 0.62% in 2021 to 2.14% in 2022.\nThe fair value of stock options, which are subject to graded vesting, are recognized as compensation\nexpense over the requisite service period using the accelerated attribution method. The fair value of RSUs that\nare subject to cliff vesting are recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period using the\nstraight-line attribution method, and the fair value of RSUs that are subject to graded vesting are recognized\nas compensation expense over the requisite service period using the accelerated attribution method. The fair\nvalue of PSUs are recognized as compensation expense beginning at the time in which the performance\nconditions are deemed probable of achievement. We assess the probability of achievement of performance\nconditions, including projected product revenues and clinical development milestones, as of the end of each\nreporting period. Once a performance condition is considered probable, we record compensation expense\nbased on the portion of the service period elapsed to date with respect to that award, with a cumulative\ncatch-up, net of estimated forfeitures, and recognize any remaining compensation expense, if any, over the\nremaining requisite service period using the straight-line attribution method for PSUs that are subject to cliff\nvesting and using the accelerated attribution method for PSUs that are subject to graded vesting.\nCompensation expense for PSUs with market performance conditions is calculated using a Monte Carlo\nsimulation model as of the date of grant and recorded over the requisite service period.\nIncome Taxes.\nWe account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach to financial accounting\nfor income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference\nbetween the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax\nrates in effect for years in which the basis differences are expected to reverse. We periodically assess the\nlikelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets, and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets\nto an amount that is considered to be more-likely-than-not to be realizable. Our assessment considers recent\ncumulative earnings experience, projections of future taxable income (losses) and ongoing prudent and feasible\ntax planning strategies. When performing our assessment on projections of future taxable income (losses), we\nconsider factors such as the likelihood of regulatory approval and commercial success of products currently\nunder development, among other factors. Significant judgment is required in making this assessment and, to\nthe extent that a reversal of any portion of our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets is deemed\nappropriate, a tax benefit will be recognized against our income tax provision in the period of such reversal.\nWe recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the\nposition will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, including resolutions of any related\nappeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit that is recorded\nfor these positions is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being\nrealized upon ultimate settlement. We adjust the level of the liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the\nrelevant facts surrounding the uncertain positions. Any interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions are\nincluded within the tax provision.\nWe record estimates and prepare and file tax returns in various jurisdictions across the United States,\nCanada, Europe, and Asia based upon our interpretation of local tax laws and regulations. While we exercise\nsignificant judgment when applying complex tax laws and regulations in these various taxing jurisdictions,\nmany of our tax returns are open to audit, and may be subject to future tax, interest, and penalty assessments.\nWe believe our estimates for the valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets and the amount\nof benefits associated with uncertain tax positions recognized in our financial statements are appropriate\nbased upon our assessment of the factors mentioned above. As a result of releasing the valuation allowance on\nthe majority of our U.S. deferred tax assets in 2021, we expect that our reported income tax expense (current\nplus deferred) for future periods will be higher than that recorded for prior periods.\n72"

      "text": "Acquisition-related contingent consideration.\nAcquisition-related contingent consideration, which\nconsists of our future royalty obligations to ARIAD/Takeda, was recorded on the acquisition date at the\nestimated fair value of the obligation, in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting using an\nincome approach based on projected future net revenues of ICLUSIG in the European Union and other\ncountries. The fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration is remeasured each reporting\nperiod, with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. The assumptions\nused to determine the fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration include projected future\nnet revenues of ICLUSIG and a discount rate, which require significant judgement and are analyzed on a\nquarterly basis. As the fair value measurement is based on significant inputs that are unobservable in the\nmarket, this represents a Level 3 measurement.\nThe valuation inputs utilized to estimate the fair value of the contingent consideration as of December 31,\n2022 and 2021 included a discount rate of 10% and updated projections of future net revenues of ICLUSIG in\nthe European Union and other countries for the approved third line treatment.\nWhile we use the best available information to prepare our projections of future net revenues of ICLUSIG\nand discount rate assumptions, actual ICLUSIG revenues and/or market conditions could differ significantly.\nChanges to one or multiple inputs could have a material impact on the amount of acquisition-related\ncontingent consideration expense recorded during the reporting period.\nResults of Operations\nYears Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021\nWe recorded net income for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 of $340.7 million and\n$948.6 million, respectively.

We expect government rebates and chargebacks\nas a percentage of our gross product sales will continue to increase in connection with any future product price\nincreases greater than the rate of inflation, and any such increase in these government rebates and chargebacks\nwill have a negative impact on our reported product revenues, net. We adjust our estimates for government\nrebates and chargebacks based on new information regarding actual rebates as it becomes available. Claims by\nthird-party payors for rebates and chargebacks are frequently submitted after the period in which the related\nsales occurred, which may result in adjustments to prior period accrual balances in the period in which the new\ninformation becomes available. Our company-sponsored patient savings program in which we provide financial\nassistance to enable commercially-insured patients to afford their insurance premium and co-pays may\nfluctuate as the commercial insurance landscape evolves and may impact net revenues, particularly for drugs\nlike OPZELURA. We also adjust our allowance for product returns based on new information regarding\nactual returns as it becomes available.\nWe expect our sales allowances to fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the Medicare Part D\nCoverage Gap, the volume of purchases eligible for government mandated discounts and rebates as well as\nchanges in discount percentages which are impacted by potential future price increases, rate of inflation, and\nother factors.\nProduct royalty revenues on commercial sales of JAKAVI and TABRECTA by Novartis are based on net\nsales of licensed products in licensed territories as provided by Novartis.

Further information on the impacts of the valuation allowance and significant\njudgments related to changes can be found in Note 13 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n2022\n2021\n(in millions)\nDecember 31:\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n$3,239.0\n$2,348.2\nWorking capital . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n$2,935.8\n$2,264.4\nYear ended December 31:\nCash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n$ 969.9\n$ 749.5\nInvesting activities\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n$\n(78.5)\n$ (207.7)\nFinancing activities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n$\n(0.8)\n$\n6.2\nCapital expenditures (included in investing activities above) . . . . . . . . . . . .\n$\n(77.8)\n$ (181.0)\nSources and Uses of Cash.\nDue to historical net losses, we had an accumulated deficit of $0.4 billion as of December 31, 2022.

At December 31, 2022, we had\navailable cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $3.2 billion. Our cash and marketable securities\nbalances are held in a variety of interest-bearing instruments, including money market accounts and U.S.\ngovernment debt securities.

During 2021, net cash used in investing activities was\n$207.7 million, which represents purchases of marketable securities of $235.2 million, capital expenditures of\n$181.0 million and purchase of long term equity investments of $33.5 million, offset in part by the sale and\nmaturity of marketable securities of $231.5 million and the sale of long term investment of $10.5 million.\nCash (used in) provided by financing activities.\nDuring 2022, net cash used in financing activities was\n$0.8 million, and in 2021, net cash provided by financing activities was $6.2 million, respectively, consisting\nprimarily of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock plans net of tax withholdings,\noffset in part by cash paid to ARIAD/Takeda for contingent consideration.\nOur capital expenditures for construction activities and our non-operating contractual operating and\nfinance lease obligations are discussed in Note 8 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In\naddition, in October 2019, we entered into an agreement with Wilmington Friends School Inc., to purchase\nproperty for $50.0 million to expand our global headquarters. Under that agreement, closing of the purchase\nis subject to certain standard closing conditions, including an initial diligence period and a subsequent approval\nperiod.\nIn August 2021, we entered into a $500.0 million, three-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility. We\nmay increase the maximum revolving commitments or add one or more incremental term loan facilities, subject\nto obtaining commitments from any participating lenders and certain other conditions, in an amount not to\nexceed $250.0 million plus a contingent additional amount that is dependent on our pro forma consolidated\nleverage ratio. As of December 31, 2022, we had no outstanding borrowings and were in compliance with all\ncovenants under this facility.\nOur U.S. income tax payments will increase significantly due to the mandatory capitalization and\namortization of research and development expenses for tax years beginning after December 31, 2021, as\nrequired under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which eliminated the immediate expensing of such expenses.\nWe believe that our cash flow from operations, together with our cash, cash equivalents and marketable\nsecurities and funds available under our revolving credit facility, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs\nfor the foreseeable future. Our cash requirements depend on numerous factors, including our expenditures in\nconnection with our drug discovery and development programs and commercialization operations;\nexpenditures in connection with litigation or other legal proceedings; costs for future facility requirements;\nand expenditures for future strategic equity investments or potential acquisitions. We have entered into and\nmay in the future seek to license additional rights relating to technologies or drug development candidates in\nconnection with our drug discovery and development programs. Under these licenses, we may be required to\npay upfront fees, milestone payments, and royalties on sales of future products. These contingent future\npayments are discussed in detail in Note 7 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTo the extent we seek to augment our existing cash resources and cash flow from operations to satisfy our\ncash requirements for future acquisitions or other strategic purposes, we expect that additional funding can be\nobtained through equity or debt financings or from other sources. The sale of equity or convertible debt\nsecurities in the future may be dilutive to our stockholders, and may provide for rights, preferences or privileges\nsenior to those of our holders of common stock. Debt financing arrangements may require us to pledge\ncertain assets or enter into covenants that could restrict our operations or our ability to incur further\nindebtedness.\nItem 7A.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nOur investments in marketable securities, which are composed primarily of U.S. government securities,\nare subject to default, changes in credit rating and changes in market value. These investments are also subject\nto interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase. As of December 31, 2022,\nmarketable securities were $287.5 million. Due to the nature of these investments, if market interest rates were\nto increase immediately and uniformly by 10% from levels as of December 31, 2022, the decline in fair value\nwould not be material.\n78"

      "text": "Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Incyte Corporation\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Incyte Corporation (the Company) as\nof December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income\n(loss), stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022,\nand the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the\nconsolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company\nat December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years\nin the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight\nBoard (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,\n2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 7,\n2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to\nexpress an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting\nfirm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in\naccordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and\nExchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that\nwe plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free\nof material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess\nthe risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing\nprocedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding\nthe amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation\nof the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the\nfinancial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and\nthat: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does\nnot alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on\nthe accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nAllowances for rebates owed pursuant to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program\nin the U.S.\nDescription of the Matter\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the\nCompany recognizes revenues for product received by its customers net of\nallowances for customer credits, including estimated rebates, chargebacks,\ndiscounts, returns, distribution service fees, patient assistance programs,\nand government rebates. Liabilities related to sales allowances are presented\nwithin accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance\nsheet and totaled $192.1 million as of December 31, 2022.\n80"

      "text": "Auditing the allowances for rebates owed pursuant to the Medicaid Drug\nRebate Program in the U.S. was complex and highly judgmental due to the\nsignificant estimation uncertainty involved in management’s assumptions,\nincluding the levels of expected utilization of these rebates based on the\namount of drugs sold to eligible patients, as well as the complexity of the\ngovernment mandated calculations. The allowances for rebates owed\npursuant to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program in the U.S. are sensitive to\nthese significant assumptions and calculations.\nHow We Addressed the Matter\nin Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the\noperating effectiveness of controls over management’s review of the\nallowances for rebates owed pursuant to the Medicaid Drug Rebate\nProgram in the U.S. For example, we tested controls over management’s\nreview of the significant assumptions, such as the utilization of these\nrebates as well as controls over management’s review of the application of\nthe government mandated calculations.\nTo test the allowances for rebates owed pursuant to the Medicaid Drug\nRebate Program in the U.S., we performed audit procedures that included,\namong others, evaluating the methodologies used and testing the significant\nassumptions discussed above. We compared the significant assumptions\nused by management to historical trends, evaluated the change in the\naccruals from prior periods, and assessed the historical accuracy of\nmanagement’s estimates against actual results. We also tested the\ncompleteness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the Company’s\ncalculations through reconciliation to third-party invoices, claims data and\nactual cash payments. In addition, we involved our governmental pricing\nspecialists to assist in evaluating management’s methodology and\ncalculations used to measure the estimated rebates.\nValuation of acquisition-related contingent consideration liability\nDescription of the Matter\nAs discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the\nCompany’s acquisition-related contingent consideration liability, which\nconsists of certain future royalty obligations on future net revenues of\nICLUSIG, is remeasured to its estimated fair value each reporting period,\nwith changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of\noperations. As of December 31, 2022, the acquisition-related contingent\nconsideration liability was $221.0 million.\nAuditing the valuation of the acquisition-related contingent consideration\nliability was complex and highly judgmental due to the significant\nestimation required in determining the fair value. In particular, the fair value\nestimate was sensitive to significant assumptions such as the discount rate\nand projected future net revenues of ICLUSIG, which are affected by\nexpectations about future industry, market and economic conditions, and\nare forward-looking and inherently uncertain.\nHow We Addressed the Matter\nin Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the\noperating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s valuation of the\nacquisition-related contingent consideration liability. For example, we\ntested the Company’s controls over management’s review of the valuation\nmodel, including controls over the significant assumptions utilized in the\ncalculation, such as the discount rate and the projected future net revenues\nof ICLUSIG.\n81"

      "text": "INCYTE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nOrganization and Business.\nIncyte Corporation (including its subsidiaries, “Incyte,”“we,”“us,”or “our”)\nis a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing proprietary therapeutics. Our\nportfolio includes compounds in various stages, ranging from preclinical to late stage development, and\ncommercialized products JAKAFI® (ruxolitinib), ICLUSIG® (ponatinib), PEMAZYRE® (pemigatinib),\nOPZELURA™(ruxolitinib cream), MINJUVI® (tafasitamab) and MONJUVI® (tafasitamab-cxix), which is\nco-commercialized. Our operations are treated as one operating segment.\nPrinciples of Consolidation.\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Incyte\nCorporation and our wholly owned subsidiaries. All inter-company accounts, transactions, and profits have\nbeen eliminated in consolidation.\nForeign Currency Translation.\nOperations in non-U.S. entities are recorded in the functional currency of\neach entity. For financial reporting purposes, the functional currency of an entity is determined by a review of\nthe source of an entity’s most predominant cash flows. The results of operations for any non-U.S. dollar\nfunctional currency entities are translated from functional currencies into U.S. dollars using the average\ncurrency rate during each month. Assets and liabilities are translated using currency rates at the end of the\nperiod. Adjustments resulting from translating the financial statements of our foreign entities that use their\nlocal currency as the functional currency into U.S. dollars are reflected as a component of other comprehensive\nincome (loss). Transaction gains and losses are recorded in other income (expense), net, in the consolidated\nstatements of operations.\nUse of Estimates.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect\nthe amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from\nthose estimates.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk.\nCash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and trade receivables are\nfinancial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk. The estimated fair value of\nfinancial instruments approximates the carrying value based on available market information. By policy, we\ninvest our excess available funds primarily in U.S. government debt securities which are securities issued or\nguaranteed by the U.S. government and money market funds that meet certain guidelines, which limits\nexposure to potential credit losses. Our receivables mainly relate to our product sales and collaborative\nagreements with pharmaceutical companies. We have not experienced any significant credit losses on cash,\ncash equivalents, marketable securities, or trade receivables to date and do not require collateral on receivables.\nCurrent Expected Credit Losses.\nFinancial assets measured at amortized cost are assessed for future\nexpected credit losses under guidance within ASC 326, Financial Instruments — Credit Losses, to determine if\napplication of an expected credit losses reserve is necessary. On a quarterly basis, receivables that resulted\nfrom revenue transactions within the scope of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and\nrecognized on an amortized cost basis are reviewed on a customer-level basis to analyze expectations of future\ncollections based upon past history of collections, payment, aging of receivables and viability of the customer\nto continue payment, as well as estimates of future economic conditions. Receivables generally consist of two\ntypes: receivables from collaborative agreements, including milestones, reimbursements for agreed-upon\nactivities and sales royalties; and receivables from customer product sales. Collaborative agreement receivables\nare closely monitored relationships with select, reputable industry peers. Collection of receivables is assessed\nwithin each collaborative partnership on a quarterly basis, including evaluation of each entity’s credit quality,\nfinancial health and past history of payment. Customer product sales receivables are independently evaluated\non a monthly basis, on which unusual items or aged receivables are closely monitored for signs of credit\ndeterioration, or indications of payment refusal. Customer product sales are with specialty pharmaceutical\ndistributors, wholesalers, and certain public and private institutions, some of which whose financial obligations\nare funded by various government agencies.\nCash and Cash Equivalents.\nCash and cash equivalents are held in banks or in custodial accounts with\nbanks. Cash equivalents are defined as all liquid investments and money market funds with maturity from\ndate of purchase of 90 days or less that are readily convertible into cash.\n88"

      "text": "Marketable Securities — Available-for-Sale.\nOur marketable securities consist of investments in U.S.\ngovernment debt securities that are classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are carried at\nfair value, based on quoted market prices and observable inputs, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax,\nreported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. We classify marketable securities that are available\nfor use in current operations as current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Realized gains and losses\nand declines in value judged to be other than temporary for available-for-sale securities are included in other\nincome (expense), net on the consolidated statements of operations. The cost of securities sold is based on the\nspecific identification method.\nAccounts Receivable.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had a de minimis amount of allowance for doubtful\naccounts, and as of December 31, 2021, we had no allowance for doubtful accounts. We provide an allowance\nfor doubtful accounts based on management’s assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts,\nwhich includes consideration of the credit worthiness and financial condition of those customers, aging of\nsuch receivables, history of collectability with the customer and the general economic environment. We record\nan allowance to reduce the receivables to the amount that is expected to be collected.\nInventory.\nInventories may consist of raw materials, work in process and finished goods and are recorded\nat the lower of cost and net realizable value. Inventory costs are primarily accounted for under the specific\nidentification method. We capitalize inventory after regulatory approval from U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA), European Medicines Agency (EMA) or Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and\nWelfare (MHLW) as the related costs are expected to be recoverable through the commercialization of the\nproduct. Costs incurred prior to approval are recorded as research and development expense in our statements\nof operations.\nRaw materials and work-in-process inventory are monitored for obsolescence, as applicable, and generally\nthe shelf life of the finished goods inventory is approximately 36 months from the start of manufacturing of\nthe finished goods, with the exception of OPZELURA, which currently has an approximate shelf life\nof 24 months. We evaluate for potential excess inventory by analyzing current and future product demand\nrelative to the remaining product shelf life. We build demand forecasts by considering factors such as, but not\nlimited to, overall market potential, market share, market acceptance and patient usage. We classify inventory\nas current on the consolidated balance sheets when we expect inventory to be consumed for commercial use\nwithin the next twelve months.\nVariable Interest Entities.\nWe perform an initial and ongoing evaluation of the entities with which we\nhave variable interests, such as equity ownership, in order to identify entities (i) that do not have sufficient\nequity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial\nsupport or (ii) in which the equity investors lack an essential characteristic of a controlling financial interest as\nvariable interest entities (“VIE” or “VIEs”). If an entity is identified as a VIE, we perform an assessment to\ndetermine whether we have both (i) the power to direct activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s\neconomic performance and (ii) have the obligation to absorb losses from or the right to receive benefits of the\nVIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. If both of these criteria are satisfied, we are identified as\nthe primary beneficiary of the VIE. As of December 31, 2022, there were no entities in which we held a\nvariable interest which we determined to be VIEs.\nLong Term Investments.\nOur long term investments consist of equity investments in common stock of\npublicly-held companies with whom we have entered into collaboration and license agreements. We classify all\nof our equity investments in common stock of publicly-held companies as long term investments on the\nconsolidated balance sheets. Our equity investments are accounted for at fair value using readily determinable\npricing available on a securities exchange on the consolidated balance sheets. All changes in fair value are\nreported in the consolidated statements of operations as an unrealized gain (loss) on long term investments.\nIn assessing whether we exercise significant influence over any of the companies in which we hold equity\ninvestments, we consider the nature and magnitude of our investment, any voting and protective rights we\nhold, any participation in the governance of the other company, and other relevant factors such as the presence\nof a collaboration or other business relationship. Currently, none of our equity investments in publicly-held\ncompanies are considered relationships in which we are able to assert control.\nProperty and Equipment, net.\nProperty and equipment, net is stated at cost, less accumulated\ndepreciation and amortization. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated\n89"

      "text": "useful lives of the respective assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated\nuseful life of the assets or lease term.\nLease Accounting.\nAll leases with a lease term greater than 12 months, regardless of lease type\nclassification, are recorded as an obligation on the balance sheet with a corresponding right-of-use asset. Both\nfinance and operating leases are reflected as liabilities on the commencement date of the lease based on the\npresent value of the lease payments to be made over the lease term. Current operating lease liabilities are\nreflected in accrued and other current liabilities and noncurrent operating lease liabilities are reflected in other\nliabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Right-of-use assets are valued at the initial measurement of the\nlease liability, plus any initial direct costs or rent prepayments, minus lease incentives and any deferred lease\npayments. Operating lease right-of-use assets are recorded in property and equipment, net on the consolidated\nbalance sheet and lease cost is recognized on a straight-line basis. For finance leases, expense is recognized as\nseparate amortization and interest expense, with higher interest expense in the earlier periods of a lease. Leases\nwith an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet and we recognize lease expense\nfor these leases on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. In determining whether a contract contains\na lease, asset and service agreements are assessed at onset and upon modification for criteria of specifically\nidentified assets, control and economic benefit.\nOther Intangible Assets, net.\nOther intangible assets, net consist of licensed intellectual property rights\nacquired in business combinations, which are reported at acquisition date fair value, less accumulated\namortization. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the\nstraight-line method.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets.\nLong-lived assets with finite lives are tested for impairment whenever\nevents or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. If\nindicators of impairment are present, the asset is tested for recoverability by comparing the carrying value of\nthe asset to the related estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset. If the\nexpected cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, then the asset is considered to be impaired\nand its carrying value is written down to fair value, based on the related estimated discounted future cash\nflows.\nGoodwill.\nGoodwill is calculated as the difference between the acquisition date fair value of the\nconsideration transferred and the values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is\nnot amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually as of October 1 or when\na triggering event occurs that could indicate a potential impairment by assessing qualitative factors or\nperforming a quantitative analysis in determining whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of net\nassets are below their carrying amounts. A reporting unit is the same as, or one level below, an operating\nsegment. Our operations are currently comprised of a single, entity wide reporting unit. We completed our\nmost recent annual impairment assessment as of October 1, 2022 and determined that the carrying value of\nour goodwill was not impaired.\nIncome Taxes.\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach which requires the\nrecognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary\ndifferences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts\nreportable for income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the\nopinion of management, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not\nbe realized. The primary factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are our recent history of cumulative\nearnings or losses, expected reversals of taxable temporary timing differences, forecasts of future taxable\nincome and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets.\nUpon evaluating and weighting both positive and negative evidence, we concluded that we should release the\nvaluation allowance on the majority of our U.S. deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2021.\nWe recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the\nposition will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, including resolutions of any related\nappeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit that is recorded\nfor these positions is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being\nrealized upon ultimate settlement. We adjust the level of the liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the\n90"

      "text": "relevant facts surrounding the uncertain positions. Any interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions are\nincluded within the tax provision.\nNet Income (Loss) Per Share.\nOur basic and diluted net income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing\nthe net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during all\nperiods presented. Options to purchase stock, restricted stock units and performance stock units are included\nin diluted earnings per share calculations, unless the effects are anti-dilutive.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\nconsists of unrealized gains or losses on our marketable debt securities that are classified as available-for-sale,\nforeign currency translation gains or losses and unrecognized actuarial gains or loss related to our defined\nbenefit pension plan.\nRevenue Recognition.\nRevenue-generating contracts are assessed under ASC 606, Revenue from\nContracts with Customers, to identify distinct performance obligations, determine the transaction price of the\ncontract and allocate the transaction price to each of the distinct performance obligations. Revenue is\nrecognized when we have satisfied a performance obligation through transferring control of the promised\ngood or service to a customer. Control, in this instance, may mean the ability to prevent other entities from\ndirecting the use of, and receiving benefit from, a good or service. We apply the following five-step model in\norder to determine this amount: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract;\n(ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations, including whether\nthey are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the\nconstraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations;\nand (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation, which for the\nCompany is generally at a point in time. We also assess collectability based primarily on the customer’s payment\nhistory and on the creditworthiness of the customer.\nProduct Revenues\nOur product revenues consist of sales of JAKAFI, OPZELURA and PEMAZYRE in the U.S., sales of\nMINJUVI, PEMAZYRE and ICLUSIG in Europe, and sales of PEMAZYRE in Japan. Product revenues\nare recognized at a point in time once we satisfy the performance obligation and control is transferred under\nthe revenue recognition criteria as described above. We sell JAKAFI, OPZELURA and PEMAZYRE to our\ncustomers in the U.S., which include specialty and retail pharmacies, specialty distributors and wholesalers.\nWe sell MINJUVI, PEMAZYRE and ICLUSIG to our customers in the European Union and certain other\njurisdictions, which include retail pharmacies, hospital pharmacies and distributors. We sell PEMAZYRE in\nJapan to an exclusive wholesaler.\nWe recognize revenues for product received by our customers net of allowances for customer credits,\nincluding estimated rebates, chargebacks, discounts, returns, distribution service fees, patient assistance\nprograms, and government rebates, such as Medicare Part D coverage gap reimbursements in the U.S. Product\nshipping and handling costs are included in cost of product revenues.\nCustomer Credits:\nOur customers are offered various forms of consideration, including allowances,\nservice fees and prompt payment discounts. We expect our customers will earn prompt payment discounts\nand, therefore, we deduct the full amount of these discounts from total product sales when revenues are\nrecognized. Service fees are also deducted from total product sales as they are earned.\nRebates and Discounts:\nAllowances for rebates include mandated discounts under the Medicaid Drug\nRebate Program in the U.S. and mandated discounts in Europe in markets where government-sponsored\nhealthcare systems are the primary payers for healthcare. Rebates are amounts owed after the final dispensing\nof the product to a benefit plan participant and are based upon contractual agreements or legal requirements\nwith public sector benefit providers. The accrual for rebates is based on statutory discount rates and expected\nutilization as well as historical data we have accumulated since product launches. In the fourth quarter of 2021\nand fiscal year 2022 for non-covered patients of OPZELURA, we offered a full buy-down program as we were\nin the process of obtaining commercial insurance coverage for OPZELURA. During 2022, we contracted\nwith the three largest group purchasing organizations to obtain coverage for OPZELURA. All full buy-down\nprograms for OPZELURA ended effective January 31, 2023.

      "text": "commercial insurance rebates are based on data received from our customers. Rebates are generally invoiced\nand paid in arrears so that the accrual balance consists of an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred\nfor the current quarter’s activity, plus an accrual balance for known prior quarters’ unpaid rebates. If actual\nfuture rebates vary from estimates, we may need to adjust prior period accruals, which would affect revenue in\nthe period of adjustment.\nChargebacks:\nChargebacks are discounts that occur when certain indirect contracted customers, which\ncurrently consist primarily of group purchasing organizations, Public Health Service institutions, non-profit\nclinics, and Federal government entities purchasing via the Federal Supply Schedule, purchase directly from\nour wholesalers. Contracted customers generally purchase the product at a discounted price. The wholesalers,\nin turn, charges back to us the difference between the price initially paid by the wholesalers and the discounted\nprice paid by the contracted customers. In addition to actual chargebacks received, we maintain an accrual for\nchargebacks based on the estimated contractual discounts on the inventory levels on hand in our distribution\nchannel. If actual future chargebacks vary from these estimates, we may need to adjust prior period accruals,\nwhich would affect revenue in the period of adjustment.\nMedicare Part D Coverage Gap:\nMedicare Part D prescription drug benefit mandates manufacturers to\nfund 70% of the Medicare Part D insurance coverage gap for prescription drugs sold to eligible patients. Our\nestimates for the expected Medicare Part D coverage gap are based on historical invoices received and in part\nfrom data received from our customers. Funding of the coverage gap is generally invoiced and paid in arrears\nso that the accrual balance consists of an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current\nquarter’s activity, plus an accrual balance for known prior quarters. If actual future funding varies from\nestimates, we may need to adjust prior period accruals, which would affect revenue in the period of adjustment.\nAdditionally, beginning in January 2020, the amount of spending required by eligible patients in the Medicare\nPart D insurance coverage gap increased 30% due to the expiration of a provision in the Patient Protection\nand Affordable Care Act, which now results in a change in the True Out of Pocket (TrOOP) calculation\nmethodology. The methodological change has resulted in an increase in required spending by patients and, in\nturn, an increase in manufacturers’ contributions on behalf of patients in the Medicare Part D insurance\ncoverage gap.\nCo-payment Assistance:\nPatients who have commercial insurance and meet certain eligibility\nrequirements may receive co-payment assistance. We accrue a liability for co-payment assistance based on\nactual program participation and estimates of program redemption using data provided by third-party\nadministrators. During the fourth quarter of 2021 and fiscal year 2022, we also offered a full buy-down\nprogram to non-covered patients of OPZELURA as we were obtaining commercial insurance coverage for\nOPZELURA. All full buy-down programs for OPZELURA ended effective January 31, 2023.\nProduct Royalty Revenues\nRoyalty revenues on commercial sales for ruxolitinib (marketed as JAKAVI® outside the United States)\nby Novartis Pharmaceutical International Ltd. (“Novartis”) are based on net sales of licensed products in\nlicensed territories as provided by Novartis. Royalty revenues on commercial sales for baricitinib (marketed as\nOLUMIANT) by Eli Lilly and Company (“Lilly”) are based on net sales of licensed products in licensed\nterritories as provided by Lilly. Royalty revenues on commercial sales for capmatinib (marketed as\nTABRECTA®) by Novartis are based on net sales of licensed products in the licensed territories as provided\nby Novartis. Royalty revenues on commercial sales for pemigatinib (marketed as PEMAZYRE®) by Innovent\nBiologics, Inc. (“Innovent”) are based on net sales of licensed products in licensed territories as provided by\nInnovent. We recognize royalty revenues in the period the sales occur.\nMilestone and Contract Revenues\nFor each collaborative research, development and/or commercialization agreement that results in revenue\nunder the guidance of ASC 606, we identify all material performance obligations, which may include the\nlicense to intellectual property and know-how, research and development activities and/or other activities. In\norder to determine the transaction price, in addition to any upfront payment, we estimate the amount of\nvariable consideration, including milestone payments, at the outset of the contract utilizing the most likely\namount method. The most likely amount method is used since the milestone payments have a binary outcome\n(i.e., we receive all or none of the milestone payment). We constrain the estimate of variable consideration\n92"

      "text": "such that it is probable that a significant reversal of previously recognized revenue will not occur. When\ndetermining if variable consideration should be constrained, management considers whether there are factors\noutside the Company’s control that could result in a significant reversal of revenue. In making these\nassessments, management considers the likelihood and magnitude of a potential reversal of revenue. These\nestimates are re-assessed each reporting period as required. Once the estimated transaction price is established,\namounts are allocated to the performance obligations that have been identified. The transaction price is\ngenerally allocated to each separate performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis.\nOut-licensing arrangements contain the right to use functional intellectual property, which is the\nunderlying performance obligation of these collaborative arrangements. If the license of our intellectual\nproperty is determined to be distinct from other performance obligations in the arrangement, the functional\nintellectual property that is transferred to the collaborative partner at the onset of the arrangement is\nconcluded to have significant standalone functionality and value at the point in time at which the intellectual\nproperty is made available to the collaborative partner. For licenses that are not distinct from other obligations\nidentified in the arrangement, we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation\nto determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time. If the\ncombined performance obligation is satisfied over time, we apply an appropriate method of measuring\nprogress for purposes of recognizing revenue from nonrefundable, upfront license fees. We evaluate the\nmeasure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjust the measure of performance and related\nrevenue recognition. For each of the three years ended December 31, 2022, we had no revenues from\nintellectual property licenses recognized over time.\nFor milestone revenues related to sales-based achievements, we recognize the milestone revenues in the\ncorresponding period of the product sale, in accordance with the guidance of ASC 606-10-55-65 for contracts\nthat include a license to intellectual property and the license is the predominant item to which the product sale\nrelates.\nSubsequent to the transfer of the intellectual property, we may earn milestones through achievement of\npre-specified developmental or regulatory events and, as such, milestones are accounted for as variable\nconsideration. We include developmental or regulatory milestones in the transaction price only to the extent\nthat it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur\nwhen the uncertainty associated with the milestone is subsequently resolved. Under the agreements currently\nin place, we do not consider these events to be within our control, but rather dependent upon the development\nactivities of our collaborative partners and the decisions made by regulatory agencies. Accordingly, these\nmilestones are not included in the transaction price until the counterparty, or third-party in the event of a\nregulatory submission, confirms the satisfaction or completion of the milestone triggering event. Given the\nhigh level of uncertainty of achievement, variable consideration associated with milestones are fully\nconstrained until confirmation of the satisfaction or completion of the milestone by the third-party.\nGenerally, the milestone events contained in our collaboration agreements coincide with the progression\nof our drugs from development, to regulatory approval and then to commercialization. The value of these\nmilestones is dictated within the contract and is fixed upon achievement and reflects the amount of\nconsideration which we expect to be entitled to in exchange for the satisfaction of that milestone. The process\nof successfully discovering a new development candidate, having it approved and successfully commercialized\nis highly uncertain. As such, the milestone payments we may earn from our partners involve a significant\ndegree of risk to achieve and therefore, subsequent milestone payments due to Incyte are recognized as revenue\nat the point in time when such milestones are achieved.\nOur collaboration agreements may also include an option for the collaborative partner to elect to\nparticipate in research and development activities, such as shared participation in additional clinical trials\nusing the compound. The presence of additional options for future participatory activities are assessed to\ndetermine if they represent material rights offered by us to the collaborative partner. We also determine\nwhether the reimbursement of research and development expenses should be accounted for as collaborative\nrevenues or an offset to research and development expenses in accordance with the provisions of gross or net\nrevenue presentation and recognize the corresponding revenues or records the corresponding offset to research\nand development expenses as incurred.\n93"

      "text": "Our collaborative agreements may also include provisions for additional future collaborative efforts, such\nas options for shared commercialization staffing or licensing of additional molecules, involvement in joint\ncommittees, or options for inclusion in negotiations of future supply rights, which at the time of each\ncollaborative agreement’s inception, are assessed to determine if these meet the definition of a performance\nobligation under ASC 606.\nCost of Product Revenues\nCost of product revenues includes all product related costs. In addition, cost of product revenues include\nroyalties owed under our collaboration and license agreements, contingent on certain conditions, and the\namortization of our licensed intellectual property for ICLUSIG using the straight-line method over the\nestimated useful life of 12.5 years from the date of acquisition on June 1, 2016 of all of the outstanding shares\nof ARIAD Pharmaceuticals (Luxembourg) S.à.r.l. (since renamed Incyte Biosciences Luxembourg S.à.r.l.)\nfrom ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“ARIAD”). Cost of product revenues also includes employee personnel\ncosts, including stock compensation, for those employees dedicated to the production of our commercial\nproducts.\nResearch and Development Costs.\nOur policy is to expense research and development costs as incurred,\nincluding amounts funded by research and development collaborations. Research and development expenses\nare comprised of costs we incur in performing research and development activities, including salary and\nbenefits; stock-based compensation expense; outsourced services and other direct expenses, including clinical\ntrial and pharmaceutical development costs; collaboration payments; expenses associated with drug supplies\nthat are not being capitalized; and infrastructure costs, including facilities costs and depreciation expense. If a\ncollaboration is a cost-sharing arrangement in which both we and our collaborator perform development\nwork and share costs, we also recognize, as research and development expense in the period when our\ncollaborator incurs development expenses, our portion of the co-development expenses that we are obligated\nto reimburse. Costs incurred under the collaboration arrangement that are reimbursable to us are recorded net\nagainst the related research and development expenses in the period in which the related expense is incurred.\nWe often contract with contract research organizations (“CROs”) to facilitate, coordinate and perform\nagreed upon research and development of a new drug. To ensure that research and development costs are\nexpensed as incurred, we record monthly accruals for clinical trials and preclinical testing costs based on the\nwork performed under the contract. These CRO contracts typically call for the payment of fees for services at\nthe initiation of the contract and/or upon the achievement of certain clinical trial milestones. In the event that\nwe prepay CRO fees, we record the prepayment as a prepaid asset and amortize the asset into research and\ndevelopment expense over the period of time the contracted research and development services are performed.\nMost professional fees, including project and clinical management, data management, monitoring, and\nmedical writing fees are incurred throughout the contract period. These professional fees are expensed based\non their percentage of completion at a particular date. Our CRO contracts generally include pass through fees.\nPass through fees include, but are not limited to, regulatory expenses, investigator fees, travel costs, and other\nmiscellaneous costs, including shipping and printing fees. We expense the costs of pass through fees under our\nCRO contracts as they are incurred, based on the best information available to us at the time. The estimates of\nthe pass through fees incurred are based on the amount of work completed for the clinical trial and are\nmonitored through correspondence with the CROs, internal reviews and a review of contractual terms. The\nfactors utilized to derive the estimates include the number of patients enrolled, duration of the clinical trial,\nestimated patient attrition, screening rate and length of the dosing regimen. CRO fees incurred to set up the\nclinical trial are expensed during the setup period.\nStock Compensation.\nShare-based payment transactions with employees, which include stock options,\nrestricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance shares (“PSUs”), are recognized as compensation expense\nover the requisite service period based on their estimated fair values as well as expected forfeiture rates. The\nstock compensation process requires significant judgment and the use of estimates, particularly surrounding\nBlack-Scholes assumptions such as stock price volatility over the option term and expected option lives, as\nwell as expected forfeiture rates and the probability of PSUs vesting. The fair value of stock options, which are\nsubject to graded vesting, are recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period using the\naccelerated attribution method. The fair value of RSUs that are subject to cliff vesting are recognized as\ncompensation expense over the requisite service period using the straight-line attribution method, and the fair\n94"

The fair value of PSUs are recognized as\ncompensation expense beginning at the time in which the performance conditions are deemed probable of\nachievement, which we assess as of the end of each reporting period. Once a performance condition is\nconsidered probable, we record compensation expense based on the portion of the service period elapsed to\ndate with respect to that award, with a cumulative catch-up, net of estimated forfeitures, and recognize any\nremaining compensation expense, if any, over the remaining requisite service period using the straight-line\nattribution method for PSUs that are subject to cliff vesting and using the accelerated attribution method for\nPSUs that are subject to graded vesting. Compensation expense for PSUs with market performance conditions\nis calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model as of the date of grant and recorded over the requisite\nservice period.\nAdvertising Expenses.\nAdvertising expenses, comprised primarily of television, radio, print media and\nInternet advertising, are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, advertising expenses were approximately\n$196.4 million, $66.0 million, and $28.9 million, respectively.\nLong Term Incentive Plans.\nWe have long term incentive plans which provide eligible employees with\nthe opportunity to receive performance and service-based incentive compensation, which may be comprised\nof cash, stock options, restricted stock units and/or performance shares. The payment of cash and the grant\nor vesting of equity may be contingent upon the achievement of pre-determined regulatory, sales and internal\nperformance milestones.\nAcquisition-Related Contingent Consideration.\nAcquisition-related contingent consideration consists of\nour future royalty obligations on future net revenues of ICLUSIG owed to Takeda Pharmaceutical Company\nLimited, which acquired ARIAD (“Takeda”). Acquisition-related contingent consideration was recorded on\nthe acquisition date of June 1, 2016 at the estimated fair value of the obligation, in accordance with the\nacquisition method of accounting. The fair value measurement is based on significant inputs that are\nunobservable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement. The fair value of the\nacquisition-related contingent consideration is remeasured each reporting period, with changes in fair value\nrecorded in the consolidated statements of operations.\nAcquisitions.\nTo determine whether acquisitions should be accounted for as a business combination or\nas an asset acquisition, we make certain judgments, which include assessing whether the acquired set of\nactivities and assets would meet the definition of a business under the relevant accounting rules. If the acquired\nset of activities and assets meets the definition of a business, assets acquired and liabilities assumed are\nrequired to be recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase\nprice over the fair value of the acquired net assets, where applicable, is recorded as goodwill. If the acquired set\nof activities and assets does not meet the definition of a business, the transaction is recorded as an asset\nacquisition, with the purchase price being allocated to the acquired asset, with no goodwill recorded. For a\ntransaction recorded as an asset acquisition, any acquired in-process research and development that does not\nhave an alternative future use is charged to expense at the acquisition date. See Note 5 for additional\ninformation.\n(Profit) and loss sharing under collaboration agreements.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022 and\n2021, (profit) and loss sharing under collaboration agreements represents our 50% share of the United States\nloss for commercialization of MONJUVI (tafasitamab-cxix) under our agreement with MorphoSys, which is\ndescribed in Note 7 below.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nAs of December 31, 2022, there were no new accounting pronouncements issued or adopted that may\nhave a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows upon their\nadoption.\n95"

The standard outlines a valuation framework and creates a fair value hierarchy in order to increase the\nconsistency and comparability of fair value measurements and the related disclosures. In determining fair\nvalue, we use quoted prices and observable inputs. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants\nwould use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of us. The\nfair value hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the source of inputs as follows:\nLevel 1 — Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 — Valuations based on observable inputs and quoted prices in active markets for similar assets\nand liabilities.\n96"

The concentration of credit risk relating to our other product\nrevenues or accounts receivable is not significant.\nWe assessed our collaborative and customer receivable assets as of December 31, 2022 according to our\naccounting policy for applying reserves for expected credit losses, noting minimal history of uncollectible\nreceivables and the continued perceived creditworthiness of our third party sales relationships, upon which the\nexpected credit losses were considered de minimis.\nNote 5. Acquisitions\nOn November 17, 2022, we completed our acquisition of 100% of the outstanding shares of Villaris\nTherapeutics, Inc. (“Villaris”). Villaris is an early-stage biopharma company focused on the development of\nnovel antibody therapeutics for vitiligo.\nWe evaluated the acquired set of activities and assets, and concluded that the acquisition of Villaris did\nnot meet the definition of a business, as substantially all of the purchase price was concentrated in a single\nidentifiable preclinical asset. Therefore, the transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition.\nUnder the terms of the acquisition agreement, we made an upfront payment of $70.3 million, which was\nattributed to the fair value of the preclinical asset acquired. As the preclinical asset had no alternative future\nuse at the date of acquisition, the entire upfront payment amount was expensed to research and development\nexpense on the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022. There were no\nmaterial assets or liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as part of this acquisition. Former\nVillaris stockholders are eligible to receive up to $310.0 million upon achievement of certain development and\nregulatory milestones, as well as up to an additional $1.05 billion in commercial milestones on net sales of\ncommercialized products. We will accrue for these milestone payments in the future when it becomes probable\nthey will be achieved.\nNote 6.

At December 31, 2022, $79.0 million of inventory was classified as non-current on the\nconsolidated balance sheet as we did not expect this inventory to be consumed for commercial use within the\nnext twelve months. We obtain some inventory components from a limited number of suppliers due to\ntechnology, availability, price, quality or other considerations. The loss of a supplier, the deterioration of our\nrelationship with a supplier, or any unilateral violation of the contractual terms under which we are supplied\ncomponents by a supplier could adversely affect our total revenues and gross margins.\nWe capitalize inventory after regulatory approval as the related costs are expected to be recoverable\nthrough the commercialization of the product. Costs incurred prior to regulatory approval are recorded as\nresearch and development expense in our statements of operations. At December 31, 2022, inventory with\napproximately $47.5 million of product costs incurred prior to regulatory approval had not yet been sold. We\nexpect to sell the pre-commercialization inventory over the next 25 months and, as a result, cost of product\nrevenues will reflect a lower average per unit cost of materials.\nNote 7. License Agreements\nNovartis\nIn November 2009, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement with Novartis. Under the\nterms of the agreement, Novartis received exclusive development and commercialization rights outside of the\nUnited States to our JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib and certain back-up compounds for hematologic and oncology\nindications, including all hematological malignancies, solid tumors and myeloproliferative diseases. We\nretained exclusive development and commercialization rights to JAKAFI (ruxolitinib) in the United States\nand in certain other indications. Novartis also received worldwide exclusive development and\ncommercialization rights to our MET inhibitor compound capmatinib and certain back-up compounds in all\nindications.\nUnder this agreement, we were initially eligible to receive up to $174.0 million for the achievement of\ndevelopment milestones, up to $495.0 million for the achievement of regulatory milestones and up to\n$500.0 million for the achievement of sales milestones. In addition, we are eligible to receive up to $75.0 million\nof additional potential development and regulatory milestones relating to graft-versus-host-disease\n(“GVHD”). We have recognized and received, in the aggregate, $157.0 million for the achievement of\ndevelopment milestones, $340.0 million for the achievement of regulatory milestones and $200.0 million for\nthe achievement of sales milestones through December 31, 2022.\nWe recognize development and regulatory milestones upon confirmation of achievement of the event, as\ndevelopment and regulatory approvals are events not controllable by us but rather development activities of\nNovartis and decisions made by regulatory agencies. We recognize sales milestones in the corresponding period\nof the product sale upon confirmation of net sales milestone threshold achievement by Novartis.\nIn April 2022, we recognized a $15.0 million regulatory milestone for the positive opinion issued by the\nCommittee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the EMA that recommends granting\nmarketing authorization for capmatinib (TABRECTA) as a monotherapy for the treatment of adults with\nadvanced non-small cell lung cancer. Additionally, in May 2022, we recognized a $45.0 million regulatory\nmilestone as a result of the European Commission’s approval of JAKAVI (ruxolitinib) as the first post-steroid\ntreatment for acute and chronic GVHD.\nWe also are eligible to receive tiered, double-digit royalties ranging from the upper-teens to the\nmid-twenties on future JAKAVI net sales outside of the United States, and tiered, worldwide royalties on\nTABRECTA net sales that range from 12% to 14%. We are obligated to pay to Novartis tiered royalties in the\nlow single-digits on future JAKAFI net sales within the United States contingent on certain conditions. During\nthe years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, such royalties on net sales within the United States totaled\n$113.1 million, $99.6 million and $89.9 million, respectively, and were reflected in cost of product revenues on\nthe consolidated statements of operations. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, $253.5 million and $148.1 million,\nrespectively, of accrued royalties were included in accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated\nbalance sheets, payment of which is dependent on the outcome of a contract dispute with Novartis.

Under the terms of\nthe agreement, Lilly received exclusive worldwide development and\ncommercialization rights to our JAK inhibitor baricitinib, and certain back-up compounds for inflammatory\nand autoimmune diseases.\nUnder this agreement, we were initially eligible to receive up to $150.0 million for the achievement of\ndevelopment milestones, up to $365.0 million for the achievement of regulatory milestones and up to\n$150.0 million for the achievement of sales milestones. We have recognized and received, in aggregate,\n$149.0 million for the achievement of development milestones, $335.0 million for the achievement of\nregulatory milestones and $50.0 million for the achievement of sales milestones through December 31, 2022.\nWe are also eligible to receive tiered, double-digit royalties on future global sales with rates ranging up to the\nmid-twenties if a product is successfully commercialized.\nWe recognize development and regulatory milestones upon confirmation of achievement of the event, as\ndevelopment and regulatory approvals are events not controllable by us but rather development activities of\nLilly and decisions made by regulatory agencies. We recognize sales milestones in the corresponding period of\nthe product sale upon confirmation of net sales milestone threshold achievement by Lilly.\nIn May 2020, we amended our agreement with Lilly to enable Lilly to develop and commercialize\nbaricitinib for the treatment of COVID-19. As part of the amended agreement, in addition to the royalties\ndescribed above, we will be entitled to receive additional royalty payments with rates in the low teens on global\nnet sales of baricitinib for the treatment of COVID-19 that exceed a specified aggregate global net sales\nthreshold.\nIn June 2022, we recognized a $40.0 million regulatory milestone for the FDA approval of OLUMIANT\nas a first-in-disease systemic treatment for adults with severe alopecia areata. Additionally, in June 2022, we\nrecognized a $20.0 million regulatory milestone for the European Commission’s approval for OLUMIANT\nfor the treatment of adults with severe alopecia areata, and a $10.0 million regulatory milestone for the\nMinistry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan’s approval for OLUMIANT for the treatment of adults\nwith severe alopecia areata in Japan.\nThe Lilly agreement will continue until Lilly no longer has any royalty payment obligations or, if earlier,\nthe termination of the agreement in accordance with its terms.

In addition, for the years\nended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recorded $134.5 million, $220.9 million and $110.9 million,\nrespectively, of product royalty revenues related to Lilly net sales of OLUMIANT outside the United States.\nLilly — Ruxolitinib\nIn March 2016, we entered into an amendment to the agreement with Lilly that amended the non-compete\nprovision of the agreement to allow us to engage in the development and commercialization of ruxolitinib in\nthe GVHD field. Lilly is eligible to receive up to $40.0 million in regulatory milestone payments relating to\nruxolitinib in the GVHD field. In May 2019, the approval of JAKAFI in steroid-refractory acute GVHD\ntriggered a $20.0 million milestone payment to Lilly. In March 2022, the positive recommendation from the\nEuropean Medicines Agency for regulatory approval of ruxolitinib in the GVHD field triggered an additional\n$20.0 million milestone payment to Lilly, which was recorded as research and development expense in our\nconsolidated statements of operations.\nAgenus\nIn January 2015, we entered into a License, Development and Commercialization Agreement with Agenus\nInc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, 4-Antibody AG (now known as Agenus Switzerland Inc.), which we\ncollectively refer to as Agenus. Under this agreement, which was amended in February 2017, the parties have\nagreed to collaborate on the discovery of novel immuno-therapeutics using Agenus’ antibody discovery\nplatforms. Under the terms of the amended agreement, we received exclusive worldwide development and\ncommercialization rights to four checkpoint modulators directed against GITR, OX40, LAG-3 and TIM-3 as\nwell as two undisclosed targets. Targets may be designated profit-share programs, where all costs and profits\nare shared equally by us and Agenus, or royalty-bearing programs, where we are responsible for all costs\nassociated with discovery, preclinical, clinical development and commercialization activities. There are\ncurrently no profit-share programs. For each royalty-bearing product other than GITR and one undisclosed\ntarget, Agenus will be eligible to receive tiered royalties on global net sales ranging from 6% to 12%. For GITR\nand one undisclosed target, Agenus will be eligible to receive 15% royalties on global net sales. The agreement\nmay be terminated by us for convenience upon 12 months’ notice and may also be terminated under certain\nother circumstances, including material breach. On October 19, 2022 we notified Agenus that we were\nterminating the OX40 project.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we have paid Agenus milestones totaling $30.0 million and Agenus is eligible to\nreceive up to an additional $500.0 million in future contingent development, regulatory and commercialization\nmilestones across all programs in the collaboration.\nIn addition, in 2017 we also agreed to purchase 10.0 million shares of Agenus common stock for an\naggregate purchase price of $60.0 million in cash, or $6.00 per share. In 2020, we sold an aggregate of\napproximately 3.7 million shares of Agenus common stock resulting in gross proceeds of approximately\n$17.2 million. In 2021, we sold an aggregate of approximately 2.0 million shares of Agenus common stock\nresulting in gross proceeds of approximately $10.5 million. The fair market value of our long term investment\nin Agenus as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $29.0 million and $38.9 million, respectively.\nWe are accounting for our shares held in Agenus at fair value whereby the investment is marked to market\nthrough earnings in each reporting period. Given our intent to hold the investment for the foreseeable future,\nwe have classified the investment within long term investments on the accompanying consolidated balance\nsheets.

The collaboration encompasses\nup to ten independent programs.\nIn January 2022, we decided to opt-out of the continued development of MCLA-145, a bispecific\nantibody targeting PD-L1 and CD137. We continue to collaborate with Merus and leverage the Merus\nplatform to develop a pipeline of novel agents, as we continue to hold worldwide exclusive development and\ncommercialization rights to up to ten additional programs. Of these ten additional programs, Merus retained\nthe option, subject to certain conditions, to co-fund development of up to two such programs. If Merus\nexercises its co-funding option for a program, Merus would be responsible for funding 35% of the associated\nfuture global development costs and, for certain of such programs, would be responsible for reimbursing us\nfor certain development costs incurred prior to the option exercise. Merus will also have the right to participate\nin a specified proportion of detailing activities in the United States for one of those co-developed programs.\nAll costs related to the co-funded collaboration programs are subject to joint research and development plans\nand overseen by a joint development committee, but we will have final determination as to such plans in cases\nof dispute.

If Merus\nopts to cease co-funding a program as to which it exercised its co-development option, then Merus will no\nlonger receive a share of profits in the United States but will be eligible to receive the same milestones from the\nco-funding termination date and the same tiered royalties described above with respect to programs where\nMerus does not have a right to co-fund development and, depending on the stage at which Merus chose to\ncease co-funding development costs, Merus will be eligible to receive additional royalties ranging up to 4% of\nnet sales in the United States. As of December 31, 2022, we have paid Merus milestones totaling $3.0 million,\nwhich was recorded as research and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations.\nThe Merus agreement will continue on a program-by-program basis until we have no royalty payment\nobligations with respect to such program or, if earlier, the termination of the agreement or any program in\naccordance with the terms of the agreement. The agreement may be terminated in its entirety or on a\nprogram-by-program basis by us for convenience. The agreement may also be terminated by either party\nunder certain other circumstances, including material breach, as set forth in the agreement. If the agreement is\nterminated with respect to one or more programs, all rights in the terminated programs revert to Merus,\nsubject to payment to us of a reverse royalty of up to 4% on sales of future products, if Merus elects to pursue\ndevelopment and commercialization of products arising from the terminated programs.\nIn addition, in 2016 we entered into a Share Subscription Agreement with Merus, pursuant to which we\npurchased 3.2 million common shares of Merus for an aggregate purchase price of $80.0 million in cash, or\n$25.00 per share. In January 2021, we purchased 350,000 common shares in Merus’ underwritten public\noffering of 4,848,485 common shares at the public offering price of $24.75 per share, or an aggregate purchase\nprice of $8.7 million. The fair market value of our total long term investment in Merus as of December 31,\n2022 and 2021 was $54.9 million and $112.9 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, we owned\napproximately 8% of the outstanding common shares of Merus.\nWe have concluded that we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over Merus\nbased primarily on our ownership interest, the level of intra-entity transactions between us and Merus related\nto development expenses, as well as other qualitative factors. We have elected the fair value option to account\nfor our long term investment in Merus whereby the investment is marked to market through earnings in each\nreporting period. We believe the fair value option to be the most appropriate accounting method to account\nfor securities in publicly held collaborators for which we have significant influence.

The\nexpected life calculation is based on the observed and expected time to the exercise of options by our employees\nbased on historical exercise patterns for similar type options. Expected volatility is based on the historical\nvolatility of our common stock over the period commensurate with the expected life of the options. A dividend\nyield of zero is assumed based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and have no present intention\nto pay cash dividends. Nonemployee awards are measured on the grant date by estimating the fair value of the\nequity instruments to be issued using the expected term, similar to our employee awards.\nBased on our historical experience of employee turnover, we have assumed an annualized forfeiture rate\nof 5% for our options, PSUs and RSUs. Under the true-up provisions of the stock compensation guidance, we\nwill record additional expense as the awards vest if the actual forfeiture rate is lower than we estimated, and\nwill record a recovery of prior expense if the actual forfeiture is higher than we estimated.\nTotal compensation cost of options granted but not yet vested as of December 31, 2022, was\n$40.9 million, which is expected to be recognized over the weighted average period of 1.0 years. Total\ncompensation cost of RSUs granted but not yet vested, as of December 31, 2022, was $200.7 million, which is\nexpected to be recognized over the weighted average period of 1.8 years. Total compensation cost of PSUs\ngranted but not yet vested, as of December 31, 2022, was $26.4 million, which is expected to be recognized\nover the weighted average period of 1.9 years, should the underlying performance conditions be deemed\nprobable of achievement.\nNote 13.

During the years ending December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded interest and\npenalties as a component of income tax expense of $3.8 million and $0.6 million, respectively. We do not\nanticipate any significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits during the next twelve months.\nWe file U.S. federal, state and local income tax returns and income tax returns in various foreign\njurisdictions, with statutes of limitation generally ranging from three to five years during which such tax\nreturns may be audited by the relevant tax authorities. Those statutes could be extended due to NOL or tax\ncredit carryforwards generated during these periods that are subsequently utilized in open tax periods.

Employee Benefit Plans\nDefined Contribution Plans\nWe have a defined contribution plan qualified under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code\ncovering all U.S. employees and defined contribution plans for other Incyte employees in Europe and Japan.\nEmployees may contribute a portion of their compensation, which is then matched by us, subject to certain\nlimitations. Defined contribution expense was $18.7 million, $16.7 million and $13.4 million for the years\nended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans\nWe have defined benefit pension plans for our employees in Europe which provide benefits to employees\nupon retirement, death or disability. The assets of the pension plans are held in collective investment accounts\nrepresented by the cash surrender value of an insurance policy and are classified as Level 2 within the fair\nvalue hierarchy.\nThe pension plans assumptions reflect the expected investment return and discount rate on plan assets\nand disability rate probabilities. The benefit obligation at December 31, 2022 for the plans was determined\nusing a discount rate of 2.20% and rate of compensation increase of 2.25%. The 2022 net periodic benefit cost\nfor the plans was determined using discount rates of 0.20%, rates of compensation increase of 2.00% and long\nterm expected return on plan assets of 4.50%. The benefit obligation at December 31, 2021 for the plans was\ndetermined using a discount rate of 0.20% and rate of compensation increase of 2.00%.

In our\nopinion, Incyte Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control\nover financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight\nBoard (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022\nand 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’equity\nand cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and\nour report dated February 7, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial\nreporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the\naccompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our\nresponsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our\naudit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that\nwe plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over\nfinancial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the\nrisk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal\ncontrol based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the\ncircumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable\nassurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for\nexternal purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control\nover financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records\nthat, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the\ncompany; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation\nof financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and\nexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and\ndirectors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the\nfinancial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the\npolicies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\nFebruary 7, 2023\n121"
