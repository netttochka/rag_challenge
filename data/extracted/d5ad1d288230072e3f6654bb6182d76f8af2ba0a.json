      "text": "8 \nabrdn Japan Investment Trust plc \nA year ago I wrote that we had come through a \nmomentous year with the challenges of Covid-19 and its \nsignificant impact globally. We recognised the risks \nrelating to Covid-19 had not gone away and that inflation \nwas a looming threat. In our more recent interim report we \nadded slowing Chinese growth to the list of concerns. \nHowever, we certainly did not anticipate the Russian \ninvasion of Ukraine, which has had a profound impact \ngeopolitically and on the global economy, and whose \noutcome and longer term effects remain uncertain.   \nOverview  \nThe Japanese stock market moved through a number of \nalternating phases during the year: early on, markets \nbenefited from positive investor sentiment arising from \nvaccine breakthroughs and improved economic data. \nThen fears of rising infections, the initially slow vaccination \nprogramme and Tokyo entering its third emergency \nlockdown weighed on markets in the late spring and early \nsummer. However, Japan became one of the strongest \nmajor developed markets in August and September 2021, \nas investors reacted positively to the change in the \npolitical landscape and easing of the Covid-19 pandemic. \nFumio Kishida replaced former prime minister Yoshihide \nSuga as leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party in \nthe third quarter, and the party comfortably retained \npower in the general election held at the end of October.  \nIn November 2021, Prime Minister Kishida released details \nof a stimulus package of almost ¥56 trillion. The measures \nincluded direct payments to families with children and \nsupport for businesses. However, in common with global \nstock markets, Japanese equities sold-off abruptly in \nJanuary 2022, with technology-related stocks especially \nweak. Unlike the US Federal Reserve, however, the Bank of \nJapan (“BoJ”) indicated that it will not raise interest rates \nquickly. The initial impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on \nthe Japanese stock market was limited. While Russia is a \nrelatively small trading partner for Japan, the implications \nof the invasion for global energy prices are very relevant \ngiven that Japan is an energy-importer. Inflation is rising in \nJapan with implications for the consumer and businesses. \nPerformance \nPerformance weakened in the second half of the year. \nThe Company’s net asset value (NAV) total return for the \nyear to 31 March 2022 was -10.0%, underperforming the \nTOPIX benchmark’s -2.7% total return, both in sterling \nterms. \nThe Company’s medium-term relative performance \nremains strong, with a NAV return of 24.1% over the last \nthree years, compared to the benchmark return of 18.4%. \nThe Company’s Ordinary share price ended the year at \n635.0p, down 92.5p on 31 March 2021. The total return for \nthe period was -10.9% with dividends reinvested and the \ndiscount to NAV per Ordinary share widened slightly from \n9.9% to 11.0% as at 31 March 2022. \nDividend \nThe Board continues to believe in the importance of \nincome to our shareholders and makes use of the benefits \nof the investment trust structure to allow the Company to \nsupport the enhanced dividend policy. \nThe Company’s revenue return per share for the financial \nyear was 8.5p (2021 – 6.6p). An interim dividend of 6.0p \nhas already been declared and was paid to shareholders \non 30 December 2021. The Board proposes a final \ndividend of 9.0p, making a total dividend of 15.0p (2021 – \n15.0p) for the year ended 31 March 2022. The dividend \ncomprises 8.5p revenue return, 3.0p from revenue \nreserves and 3.5p from capital reserves. The Board \nbelieves that this level of distribution for the year continues \nto balance a prudent retention of capital for future \ninvestment with a recognition of the ongoing importance \nof income to our shareholders, especially as economic \ncircumstances worsen for many. \nGearing \nThe Company continues to make use of its capacity to \ngear through its loan facilities provided by ING Bank. \nEarlier in the year these were renewed with the Yen 1.3 \nbillion fixed term loan now expiring in January 2023 and \nthe Yen 1.0 billion floating rate facility now extended to \nexpire in December 2024. Further details can be found on \npage 40. \nThe Board considers a gearing level of around 10% to be \nappropriate, although, with stock market fluctuations, this \nmay range between 5–15%. Net gearing as at 31 March \n2022 was 11.4% (2021: 10.0%). \nThe Board believes that the potential to gear the portfolio \nat the right time is one of the strong advantages of the \nclosed ended company structure, with the sensible use of \nmodest financial gearing seeking to enhance returns  \nto shareholders. \nEnvironmental, Social & Corporate \nGovernance (“ESG”)  \nJapan is changing its approach and embracing the \nprinciples of ESG. This development and improvement, \nparticularly on the corporate governance front, has \naccelerated over the year under review.

Encouragingly, companies are more \nwilling to engage with investors, and the composition of \nboards is growing more inclusive and diverse. Overall, \nthese developments foster a change in attitude, with \nmanagement more mindful of helping to not only \npreserve, but also enhance, shareholder value, both in \ntheir day-to-day decisions and at more strategic \npolicymaking levels. Additionally, your Manager has been \nworking with several companies to encourage them to \ntrack their key indicators (such as carbon emissions, \nsupply chain management, carbon intensity, and health \nand safety) and to disclose these regularly. Meticulously \ntracking and then publishing these numbers will not only \nhelp companies provide an objective track record that will \nresult in improved ESG standards, but also keep them \naccountable in sticking to the targets that they have set \nfor themselves. It is also worth noting that Japanese \ncompanies have an added advantage, in that they \npossess the technology and leading-edge materials that \ncan help them attain these goals. \nWith this in mind, I wanted to draw your attention to three \nexamples of engagement with companies in our portfolio. \nTokio Marine, one of our top performing holdings, has \nconsistently announced share buyback programmes. \nEarlier in 2021, the company had disappointed the market \nwith a vague explanation about its use of excess capital, \nwhich led your Manager to engage with the company’s \nmanagement on improved communication of its \nshareholder returns policy. Your Manager intends to \ncontinue its conversation with the company on this and \nother matters.  \nThe real estate developer Tokyu Fudosan Holding announced \nthe sale of its stake in DIY store Tokyu Hands to home \ncenter operator Cainz. Your Manager had been actively \nengaging with the company’s management on reviewing \nits weaker businesses to help the company build a more \nresilient organisation. It intends to continue the \nconversation with the company as there are other low-\nmargin operations that could pose risks for the business. \nYour Manager has had multiple engagements over the \nyears urging the companies whose shares are held in the \nportfolio to relinquish their poison pills, and for these \ncompanies to adopt stronger governance frameworks \nand reflect an increased awareness of shareholder \ninterests. These engagements have worked alongside a \nbroader improvement in ESG standards in the market. \nThe latest example of your Manager’s involvement is that \nwith property owner and developer Heiwa Real Estate, \nwhich decided not to bring its poison pill resolution \nforwards for a renewal vote at its annual general meeting. \nMore information on the Manager’s ESG Approach can be \nfound on pages 87 to 90 of this report. \nDiscounts and Share Buybacks \nThe Board regularly monitors the discount level of the \nCompany’s shares in relation to the NAV. There is a \nmechanism in place to buy back shares at appropriate \nlevels, when doing so will add value for shareholders, while \nhaving regard to the overall size of the Company. During \nthe financial year, 697,191 shares were bought back into \ntreasury at a cost of £.4.9 million. Since the year end, a \nfurther 45,358 shares have been repurchased at a cost of \n£265,000. \nOverall, the discount averaged 9.4% over the last 90 days \nof the Company’s financial year and there is therefore no \nrequirement under the Company’s articles of association \nto put forward a continuation vote to shareholders. \nThe Board \nFor its ongoing effectiveness, your Board believes in the \nimportance of an orderly succession plan. The Board \nregularly reviews its composition, considering the balance \nof skills and experience of the Directors, as well as their \ntenure. Having now served on the Board for nine years, \nwith over three years as Chairman, I shall retire as a \nDirector at the Annual General Meeting in 2023. Sir David \nWarren has agreed to be appointed the Senior \nIndependent Director with immediate effect. \nabrdn Rebranding \nIn July 2021, Standard Life Aberdeen plc changed its \nname to abrdn plc as part of a rebranding exercise. It is \nexpected that the Company’s Manager and Company \nSecretary (Aberdeen Standard Fund Managers Limited \nand Aberdeen Asset Management PLC respectively) will \nalso change their names in future, following the same \napproach taken by the Company’s Investment Manager, \nabrdn Japan Limited (formerly Aberdeen Standard \nInvestments (Japan) Limited). \nFollowing the abrdn name change, the Board made the \ndecision to align itself with the Manager’s new brand by \nchanging the Company’s name to abrdn Japan \nInvestment Trust plc on 9 May 2022."

If you hold your \nshares via a share plan or a platform and would like to \nattend and/or vote at the AGM, then you will need to \nmake arrangements with the administrator of your share \nplan or platform. For this purpose, investors who hold their \nshares in the Company via the abrdn Investment Plan for \nChildren, Share Plan or ISA will find a Letter of Direction \nenclosed. abrdn Planholders are encouraged to complete \nand return the Letter of Direction in accordance with  \nthe instructions. \nThe Notice of Meeting is contained on pages 98 to 102. \nOutlook \nJapan has a large, sophisticated economy which remains \nat the forefront of technological innovation and occupies \na key role in the global economy with a huge export \nsector. The country hosts a wealth of successful \ncompanies of all sizes, many with leading global market \nshares and strong products. In view of this, the Board is \noptimistic about the long term future for Japanese \nequities. Despite the multiple challenges posed by the \nongoing pandemic, rising commodity prices and the \nglobal outlook for inflation, companies with strong \nbusiness models and management teams have coped \nand, in some cases, thrived. Alongside structural \nimprovements in governance in Japan, we remain \nresolute in our belief that these companies will do well. \nWeighing the risk-reward in the market, valuations look \nattractive for these companies for the medium term. \nOn a global scale, risks remain in the system. The Omicron \nvariant of Covid-19 resulted in less severe illness and \ngovernments globally have treated the surge differently, \nsome with fewer lockdowns and less severe restrictions. \nNevertheless, infection rates are still high globally. The \neffects of high energy prices following Russia’s invasion of \nUkraine are feeding through into widespread price \ninflation – the impact is only just being felt by the Japanese \nconsumer. For now, the slow growth in the Japanese \neconomy means that the Bank of Japan will keep rates \nlow – it remains to be seen if rising inflationary pressures or \na weakening currency will change that calculation later \nin 2022. \nYour portfolio of investments, in companies with healthy \nbalance sheets and ample free cash flow, puts us in a \nstrong position. A solid fundamental base, coupled with \nmanagement teams’ experience in navigating the \npandemic and previous crises, should allow these \ncompanies to continue their recovery and progress. Many \ninvestee companies have built dominant positions in their \nown fields and should continue to thrive regardless of the \nexternal pressures faced. \nThe Board recognises that in such a difficult and complex \nenvironment, it is more important than ever to check and \nchallenge the positioning of the portfolio and the \ninvestment decisions taken by the Manager. However, the \nManager’s process of seeking out the best companies – \nwhether small, mid or large capitalisation stocks – through \nstringent screening and regular meetings with senior \nmanagement is designed to deliver the best long-term \ngrowth prospects of the underlying investments in your \nCompany’s portfolio. The Manager’s ESG focus, which is \nvery much core to the investment process, should also \nhelp to encourage effective engagement at all levels. We \nexpect better and more sustainable practices, and \nsubsequently better share price ratings, as a result of  \ntheir efforts.  \nYour Board recognises that investors have the choice of a \nrange of investment funds through which they can obtain \nexposure to Japan. We believe that the Company’s \nstrategy of seeking high quality companies, run by \ncapable management teams, with good governance, will \nserve our shareholders well over the long term.  \n \n \nKaren Brade \nChairman \n27 May 2022 \n \n \nChairman’s Statement \nContinued"

      "text": "abrdn Japan Investment Trust plc \n11 \nOverview \nThe Japanese equity market declined by 2.7% in sterling \nterms over the 12 months to 31 March 2022. The year was \ncharacterised by a strengthening economy, a change of \nPrime Minister and, towards the end of the period, a \nrelaxation of pandemic-related restrictions. \nThe Company’s NAV, however, fell by 10.0% in sterling \ntotal return terms, while the share price lost 10.9% with \ndividends reinvested. This poorer performance in the \nportfolio over the year reflected higher bond yields and \nrising inflation expectations supporting lower value \ncyclical and interest rate-sensitive financial stocks. Our \nstock choices underperformed the broader market but \nwe  believe that our investment approach – that of \ninvesting in good quality companies – will outperform over \na market cycle, especially in periods where company \nfundamentals are being rewarded. We may, however, \nunderperform when the markets are disrupted by specific \nevents or unforeseeable circumstances. This was the case \nin the past year. We recognise that our bottom-up \napproach may lead to periods of underperformance, but \nour goal remains to deliver outperformance over the \nmedium to long-term through adherence to our core \ninvestment principles. \nOn the political front, the Liberal Democratic Party’s (LDP) \npopularity suffered over the summer months. Former \nPrime Minister Yoshihide Suga was criticised for his \nhandling of the Covid-19 pandemic, and on 4 October \n2021 Fumio Kishida won the LDP leadership race to \nbecome Japan’s new prime minister. The former foreign \nminister ran against the popular vaccinations minister, \nTaro Kono, in the run-off vote, having outperformed the \ntwo female candidates in the first round. The LDP \ncomfortably retained power in the subsequent general \nelection on 31 October, although the equity market \ndeclined as investors became concerned about possible \ntax rises. The new administration proposed a stimulus \npackage of almost ¥56 trillion together with a record \nsetting annual budget for 2022. The package included \npandemic countermeasures, social spending for the \nelderly and record defence spending to prepare against \nrising regional threats. Kishida’s own ratings remain \nreasonably stable.    \nThe Covid-19 pandemic was a feature adding to \nuncertainty throughout the period. The Japanese \ngovernment declared a state of emergency in Tokyo and \nother economic hubs in January 2021. The infection rate \nundulated throughout the period, peaking in April 2021. \nAfter a slow start, Japan’s vaccination campaign gathered \nspeed in the third quarter of 2021, not long before the new \nOmicron variant was first identified. Cases surged early in \n2022, while the government began a drive for booster \nshots. Japan’s quasi-state of emergency was lifted in 18 \nprefectures, including Tokyo and Osaka, in March 2022, \nfollowing a decline in new infections and an easing strain \non hospitals. Japan has also been relaxing its border \ncontrols, with the daily cap on the number of international \narrivals increasing from 7,000 to 10,000 in April 2022. The \nbooster shot campaign that began in December 2021 had \nreached 41% of the population by the end of March 2022. \nRecent polling on the government’s handling of the \nOmicron variant has been positive. \nFortunately Japan’s economy avoided a recession in the \nsecond quarter of 2021. A rebound in consumer spending \ndefied pandemic-related restrictions, while renewed \ninvestments by businesses and increased government \nspending also underpinned a higher growth rate. Industrial \nproduction saw a record increase of 7.2% month-on-\nmonth in November 2021, on the back of a recovery in \nautomotive production as supply chain issues eased. \nHowever, in early 2022, higher inflation and a weakening \nyen has impacted sentiment. Purchasing manager index \ndata indicates that businesses expect contraction and  \nthe Bank of Japan’s Tankan survey, released soon after \nthe period end, showed falling confidence among  \nlarge manufacturers. \nRising inflation has been an issue globally. One important \ndriver has been higher energy prices, resulting from \nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine. Brent crude oil traded at \naround $108 per barrel at the end of March 2022 but had \nbeen within a whisker of $140 early in the month. \nEconomists expect the price pressure from these rising \nenergy costs will slow Japan’s economic growth. \nInternational pressure on Prime Minister Kishida to pull \naway from the Sakhalin-2 liquefied natural gas project has \nincreased; however he has refused to do so, citing energy \nshortages as a threat to the Japanese economy, and has \nannounced plans fora relief package to help households \ncope with higher fuel bills. \nWhile many developed central banks have begun hiking \ninterest rates and withdrawing support, the BoJ held \ninterest rates throughout the year. This has led to a \nwidening of the interest rate differential between the US \nand Japan and the BoJ has increased its bond buying \nprogramme in an effort to control interest rates. This  \nhas resulted in the yen weakening to a five year low,  \nproviding a tailwind for exporters, but putting pressure  \non import costs. \nIn general, corporate results have been positive. Quarterly \nreporting has reaffirmed our view that fundamentals \nremain solid for our portfolio holdings. While geopolitical \ntensions, supply shortage issues and rising raw material \ncosts have hampered a number of industries, certain \ncompanies fared well, thanks to their pricing power,  \nInvestment Manager’s Review"

Many companies reported profit increases \nand a large number have announced share buyback \nprogrammes. \nWith this backdrop, we have been busy considering the \nnew trends, assessing how they might affect the portfolio’s \nunderlying holdings, and evaluating the opportunities that \nlie ahead. We lay this out in greater detail below. \nPortfolio review \nSeveral of our holdings reported weaker-than-expected \nresults, primarily due to rising costs and component \nshortages, which has resulted in a muted near-term \noutlook for some companies and led to share price \nweakness. While the stock price declines are \ndisappointing, we believe these companies’ issues are \nmanageable and will be resolved. \nThe biggest detractor from the Company’s performance \nwas Nabtesco. The factory automation company sector \nhas struggled over the year, facing higher expenses and \nshortages of key components. Weak automotive capital \nexpenditure has meant lower investment in robots, \nslowing orders for the company’s reduction gears. The \ncompany’s recent results have been mixed, with investors \nfearing that supply chain shortages will continue to slow \nshipments. Koito Manufacturing’s profits were also weaker \nthan expected as higher raw material costs and weaker \nauto production from component shortages reduced \nmargins. While we do see some conservatism forecast \ninto its new assumptions, management made \nconsiderable cuts to its profit guidance. Elsewhere, our \nholding of Tokyo Century weighed on returns. Results from \nthe diversified financial firm have been mixed as travel-\nrelated businesses, such as its airline leasing and car rental \nsubsidiaries, remained weak due to rolling shutdowns \nacross markets. Meanwhile, the company’s aircraft \nleasing business will record an impairment from planes \nthat were leased to airlines in Russia, although we believe \nthat the exposure is contained and relatively manageable. \nIn contrast, Tokio Marine was one of our best performing \nstocks, as the company delivered impressive results and \nconsistently raised its full-year guidance to factor in \nbetter-than-expected underwriting profits and \ninvestment gains. A recent purchase of Kohoku Kogyo also \nperformed well,  further detail on the company is given \nbelow. We also benefited from our holding in mobile \noperator KDDI, which reported strong results and \nincreased its share buyback programme. KDDI offers a \nrange of bundled services that have helped raise its \naverage revenue per account. It has also been able to \ndeliver on both earnings growth and shareholder return in \nwhat is a mature market. \n \nDuring the year, we took advantage of the market’s \nvolatility to initiate several new holdings, exiting others to \nfund these more attractive investment opportunities.  \nEarly in the year, we initiated a position in AGC, a leading \nmaker of glass products, chemicals and electronics that \ntrades at attractive valuations. The company has been \nusing cash generated by mature businesses, including \nglass products, to invest in structural growth opportunities \nsuch as pharmaceutical development, manufacturing \noutsourcing, EUV mask blanks and glass and display \nproducts for next-generation vehicles. The company has \na number of world  leading products, enabling stable \ncashflow generation to support continued reinvestment in \nthe business and underpinning shareholder returns. For \nfurther details on AGC, see our case study on page 32. \nLate in 2021, we participated in the initial public offerings \nof Kohoku Kogyo and Net Protections Holdings. Kohoku \nKogyo is the global leader in manufacturing key \ncomponents used in submarine optical cables and \nautomotive aluminium electrolytic capacitors. The \ncompany’s integrated production system and its ability to \nproduce everything internally, from raw materials to \nequipment, enables it to maintain its business advantage. \nThe president, who comes from the founder’s family, is \nkeen to establish a third pillar of growth, leveraging on the \ncompany’s existing technologies. Net Protections is \nJapan’s largest Buy-Now-Pay-Later service provider. Its \ncredit technology, built on the large amount of settlement \ndata collected over its 20-year history, gives the company \na solid competitive position. The company’s offering \nrepresents an attractive solution to both parties in credit \nbased e-commerce transactions: its high and accurate \napproval rate offers retail customers frictionless \npurchasing experiences while enabling merchants to \nmaximise sales opportunities. The company also brings \nthis technology to transactions among corporate \ncustomers, offering one-stop solutions such as payment \ncollection and invoicing, aiming to replicate its success \ngained in the e-commerce business. \nTowards the end of the year, we bought Ajinomoto, Ibiden \nand Denso. Ajinomoto, Japan’s largest producer of \nseasonings, has a strong sales and product development \ncapability to develop products suited to local tastes. With \na high market share in its core business, the company \ncommands pricing power. In addition, the management \nteam have successfully restructured the business portfolio \nthrough the divestment of lower-return, commoditised \nbusinesses, while prioritising investments in value-added \nareas within foods and higher growth sectors. The \ncompany has also expanded into products such as \nsemiconductor materials and contract development and \nmanufacturing for biopharmaceuticals.

We expect a rapidly growing end-\nmarket, product innovation and a shift to higher value \nproducts to fuel the company’s future growth. Moreover, \nwe are encouraged by the improved business mix \nachieved in recent years and the reduced reliance on \ncyclical end applications such as smartphones. \nAutomotive components maker Denso has a leading \nposition in key components for electric vehicles, such as \ninverters, battery engine control units and thermal \nmanagement systems. We believe the company is well \npositioned to benefit from automotive electrification, as it \nhas the technology to provide products that help to \nimprove energy efficiency. \nWe undertook a number of sales to enable us to make \nthese purchases. Early in the year, we exited material \nhandling systems provider Daifuku, which we had \npurchased early in 2020. Valuations were no longer as \nattractive, following last year’s welcome re-rating and \nmanagement had released cautious guidance, \nanticipating a rise in fixed costs in research and \ndevelopment. In September 2021, we exited Edulab. \nFollowing the accounting investigation referenced in  \nour Half-Yearly Report, we engaged with the company  \non its governance framework and internal controls,  \nand decided it was an appropriate time to sell our  \nposition completely. \nMore recently, we sold our long-held positions in baby-\ncare products supplier, Pigeon, and car auction facility \noperator, USS, to free up cash to invest in better \nopportunities. We also sold our holding in medical \nequipment maker Sysmex due to its high valuation \ncoupled with concerns over a slowdown in China, fuelled \nby central procurement and distributor issues. Our \nposition in Honda-affiliated car parts maker Stanley \nElectric was also sold due to a deteriorating outlook amid \nsupply chain risks, elevated market expectations for near-\nterm earnings, and better opportunities elsewhere. \nOutlook \nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine, and its impact on global \ncommodity prices, has put a chill on sentiment across \nglobal markets. While the direct impact on most Japanese \ncorporates, including the Company’s holdings, is low, the \nindirect impact from sharp rises in commodity prices, \nlogistical difficulties and supply chain shortages puts \nfurther pressure on companies’ profitability.  \nFollowing this re-positioning we believe that the \nCompany’s good quality holdings – broadly defined as \nhaving tried and tested management teams, strong \nbusiness fundamentals, with above average return on \ncapital and ESG standards – should overcome the \nchallenges of the current environment. These companies \ntend to be flexible in how they manage their businesses, \nhave strong pricing power while not allowing governance \nto take a back seat. With this backdrop, and with the \nrotation in the markets earlier in the year, valuations for \nquality stocks have fallen sharply, yet commentary from \nthese companies suggests that their business \nfundamentals remain sound. We remain confident in our \nbelief that these companies will outperform over the \nmedium to longer term and offer shareholders good \nrelative returns. \n \nKwok Chern-Yeh,  \nabrdn Japan Limited \n27 May 2022"

The portfolio is constructed \nthrough the identification of individual companies of any \nmarket capitalisation and in any business sector, which \noffer long-term growth potential.  \nThe portfolio is selected from the 3,800 listed stocks in \nJapan and is actively managed to contain between 30 \nand 70 stocks which, in the Manager’s opinion, represent \nthe best basis for producing higher returns than those of \nthe market as a whole in the long term. There will \ntherefore inevitably be periods in which the Company’s \nportfolio either outperforms or underperforms the market \nas represented by the Company’s benchmark. \nThe Board does not impose any restrictions on these \nshorter term performance variations from the \nbenchmark, nor any limits on the concentration of stock or \nsector weightings within the portfolio, except that no \nindividual shareholding shall exceed 10% of the \nCompany’s portfolio at the time of purchase, although \nmarket movements may subsequently increase  \nthis percentage. \nThe full text of the Company’s investment policy is \nprovided on page 86. \nBenchmark Index \nTopix (in Sterling terms) \nInvestment Approach \nThe Investment Manager’s investment philosophy is that \nmarkets are not always efficient. The Investment \nManager’s approach is therefore that superior investment \nreturns are attainable by investing in companies with good \nfundamentals and above average growth prospects that \nin the Investment Manager’s opinion drive share prices \nover the long-term. The Investment Manager follows a \nbottom-up investment process based on a disciplined \nevaluation of companies through active engagement, at \nleast twice a year, with management on performance \nincluding environmental, social and governance issues by \nits fund managers who are based in Japan and supported \nby the Manager’s Asian investment team in Singapore. \nThe Manager estimates a company’s worth in two stages; \nquality, defined by reference to management, business \nfocus, the balance sheet and corporate governance; and \nthen price, calculated by reference to key financial ratios, \nthe market, the peer group and business prospects. \nUnderstanding a company’s management and gauging \nits experience is essential and no stock is bought without \nthe fund managers having first met management.  \nStock selection is key in constructing a diversified portfolio \nof companies with macroeconomic, political factors and \nbenchmark weightings being secondary.   \nGiven the long-term fundamental investment philosophy, \nthe Manager expects to hold most companies in which \nthe Company invests for extended periods of time. \nOverview of Strategy"

This \ngrowth will reflect both the Manager’s investment \nperformance and from time to time the issue of shares, \nwhen sufficient demand exists to do this, without diluting \nthe value of existing shareholder capital.  \nThe Board’s dividend policy is to make distributions on a \nsemi-annual basis and currently consists of the \nCompany’s earnings for the year, 3.0p released from the \nrevenue reserves and an amount from the distributable \ncapital reserves. \nThe Board will authorise the buyback of shares in order to \navoid excessive variability in the discount and if, despite \nthis, the average discount exceeds 10% during the 90 day \nperiod preceding its financial year end, the Board will offer \nshareholders the opportunity to vote on the continuation \nof the Company at a general meeting.  \nRisk Management  \nThe policy for risk management is primarily focused on the \ninvestment risk in the portfolio using the Manager’s risk \nmanagement systems and risk parameters, overseen by \nthe Board.  \nDerivatives \nThe Company may use derivatives from time to time for \nthe purpose of mitigating risk in its investments. The \nperformance of the Company is subject to fluctuations in \nthe Yen/£ exchange rate. The Company’s exposure to \nYen fluctuations is partially offset by the natural hedge \nprovided by any borrowing in Yen as well as by \ninvestments in Japanese companies which have \nsignificant sources of income from exports of goods or \nfrom non-Japanese operations.  \nThe wider corporate risks, including those arising from the \nincreasingly regulated and competitive marketplace, are \nmanaged directly by the Board. The principal risks are \nmore fully described under the paragraph ‘Principal Risks \nand Uncertainties’. \nUse of Gearing \nGearing is the amount of borrowing used to increase the \nCompany’s portfolio of investments in order to enhance \nreturns when and to the extent it is considered \nappropriate to do so or to finance share buybacks when \nnecessary. The level of borrowing under the Company’s \ninvestment policy is subject to a maximum of 25% of net \nassets but will normally be set at a stable and lower level \nthan the maximum. The Board has currently established a \ngearing level of around 10% of net assets although, with \nstock market fluctuations, this may range between 5% \nand 15%."

      "text": "16 \nabrdn Japan Investment Trust plc \nPrincipal Risks and Uncertainties \nThere are a number of risks which, if realised, could have a \nmaterial adverse effect on the Company and its business \nmodel, financial position, performance and prospects.  \nThe Board has in place a robust process to identify, assess \nand monitor the principal risks and uncertainties facing \nthe Company and to identify and evaluate newly \nemerging risks. The Company’s risks are regularly \n \n \nassessed by the Audit Committee and managed by the \nBoard through the adoption of a risk matrix which \nidentifies the key risks for the Company, including \nemerging risks, and covers strategy, investment \nmanagement, operations, shareholders, regulatory and \nfinancial obligations and third party service providers. The \nprincipal risks and uncertainties facing the Company, \nwhich have been identified by the Board, are described in \nthe table below, together with the mitigating actions. \nDescription \nMitigating Action \nTrend \nMarket, Economic and Political Risk  \nThe Company’s assets consist mainly of listed \nsecurities and the principal risks are therefore \nmarket-related. This includes concerns about stock \nmarket volatility caused by geopolitical instability, \npolitical change, economic growth, interest rates, \ncurrency, and other price risks, as well as national or \nglobal crises that are harder to predict and may \ncause major market shocks \nAn explanation of these risks and the management of them is \nincluded in Note 16 to the Financial Statements on pages 76 to 78. \nThe Board considers the composition and diversification of the \nportfolio by industry, size and growth rates, as well as purchases and \nsales, at each meeting, and in monthly papers. Individual holdings \nare discussed with the Manager, as well as views by sector and \nindustry. The Board considers geopolitical risk to have increased \nfollowing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. \nÒ  \nInvestment Strategy Risk \nThe Company and its investment objective may \nbecome unattractive to investors, leading to reduced \nreturns for shareholders, decreased demand for the \nCompany’s shares, reduced value of shareholder \nfunds and possible widening of the share price \ndiscount to NAV. \nThe Board regularly reviews and monitors: the Company’s \ninvestment objective, policy and strategy; the portfolio and its \nperformance; longer term trends in investor demand; and the \nperformance of the Manager in operating the investment policy \nagainst the long-term objectives of the Company. If appropriate, the \nBoard can propose changes in the investment objective.  \nÙ \nInvestment Management Risk \nInvestment risk arises from the Company’s exposure \nto variations of share prices within its portfolio in \nresponse to individual company and to wider \nJapanese or international factors. Investment in a \nfocussed portfolio of shares can lead to greater \nshort-term changes in the portfolio’s value than in a \nlarger portfolio of stocks and these variations will be \namplified by the use of gearing. Inappropriate \ninvestment decisions may result in the Company’s \nunderperformance against the benchmark index \nand peer group and a widening of the  \nCompany’s discount. \nThe Board relies on the Investment Manager’s skills and judgment to \nmake investment decisions based on research and analysis of \nstocks and sectors. The Board regularly monitors the investment \nperformance of the portfolio and reviews holdings, purchases and \nsales on a monthly basis, as well as with the Manager at Board \nmeetings. The Board regularly reviews performance data and \nattribution analysis and other relevant factors and, were any \nunderperformance seen as likely to be sustained, would be able to \ntake remedial measures. \nÙ \nOperational Risk \nThe Company relies on a number of third-party \nservice providers, principally the Manager, Registrar, \nCustodian and Depositary. \nThe Manager has extensive business continuity procedures and \ncontingency arrangements to ensure that they are able to continue \nto service their clients. Third parties are subject to risk-based reviews \nby the Manager. The Board reviews reports on the operation and \nefficacy of the risk management and control systems of the \nManager and other key third- party service providers, including \nthose relating to cybercrime. \nÙ \nOverview of Strategy \nContinued"

      "text": "abrdn Japan Investment Trust plc \n17 \nDescription \nMitigating Action \nTrend \nRegulatory Risk  \nThe Company operates under a complex regulatory \nenvironment. Serious breaches of regulations, such \nas Section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010, the \nUKLA Listing Rules, Companies Act 2006 and the \nAlternative Investment Fund Managers Directive \ncould lead to a number of detrimental outcomes and \nreputational damage. \nThe Board is active in ensuring that it fully complies with all \napplicable laws and regulation and is assisted by the Manager and \nother advisers in doing this. The Board believes that, while the \nconsequences of non-compliance can be severe, the control \narrangements it has put in place reduce the likelihood of  \nthis happening. \nÙ  \nShare Price and Discount risk \nThe principal risks described above can affect the \nmovement of the Company’s share price and in \nsome cases have the potential to increase the \ndiscount in the market value of the Company \ncompared with the NAV. \nThe price of the Company’s shares and its discount to NAV are not \nwholly within the Company’s control, as both are subject to market \nvolatility, as witnessed through the pandemic and more recently \nwith Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, where the discount has increased \nduring the year. However, the Board can influence this through the \nability to authorise the buyback of existing shares, when deemed to \nbe in the best interests of shareholders. The share price, NAV and \ndiscount are monitored daily by the Manager and regularly \nreviewed by the Board.  \nÒ \nLeverage \nThe Company may borrow money for investment \npurposes. If investments fall in value, gearing has the \neffect of magnifying the extent of this fall. \nThe maximum level of borrowing permitted by the Company’s \ninvestment policy is 25% of net assets. All borrowing requires prior \napproval of the Board. In order to manage the level of gearing, the \nBoard has established a gearing level of around 10% of net assets \nalthough, with stock market fluctuations, this may range between \n5% and 15%. The Board regularly reviews the Company's gearing \nlevels and its compliance with bank covenants. \nÙ \nPandemic \nThe Board is cognisant of the risks arising from a \nglobal pandemic, including stock market instability \nand longer term economic effects, and the impact \non the operations of the third-party suppliers, \nincluding the Manager. \nThe Manager’s robust and disciplined investment process is focused \non long term company fundamentals including balance sheet \nstrength and deliverability of sustainable earnings growth. As part of \nthat process, the Manager continues to assess and review the \ninvestment risks arising from a global pandemic on companies in the \nportfolio, including but not limited to: employee absence, reduced \ndemand, supply chain breakdown, balance sheet strength, ability to \npay dividends, and takes the necessary investment decisions.  \nThe Manager has business continuity procedures and contingency \narrangements to ensure they are able to service their clients, \nincluding investment trusts. The services from third parties, including \nthe Manager, have continued to be supplied effectively and the \nBoard will continue to monitor arrangements through regular \nupdates from the Manager \nÙ  \nESG Risks \nApplying ESG and sustainability criteria in the \ninvestment process may result in loss of value from \ncompanies in which the Company might otherwise \ninvest. The Manager also monitors and responds to \nESG and sustainability risks at portfolio companies as \nthey evolve over time. This may have a positive or \nnegative impact on performance. \nThe Board supports the Manager’s active engagement and analysis \nof ESG and risks associated with climate change. The Board reviews \nESG engagement by the Manager on a quarterly basis, and \ncompany research notes in the board papers address and rate ESG \nrisks for all new investments. \nÙ \n \nIn all other respects, the Company’s principal risks and uncertainties have not changed materially since the year end."

Under \nsection 172, the Directors have a duty to promote the \nsuccess of the Company for the benefit of its members as \na whole, taking into account the likely long term \nconsequences of decisions, the need to foster \nrelationships with the Company’s stakeholders and the \nimpact of the Company’s operations on the environment. \nThe Company consists of four Directors and has no \nemployees or customers in the traditional sense. As the \nCompany has no employees, the culture of the Company \nis embodied in the Board of Directors. The Board seeks to \npromote a culture of strong governance and to challenge, \nin a constructive and respectful way, the Company’s \nadvisers and other stakeholders. \nThe Board’s principal concern has been, and continues to \nbe, the interests of the Company’s shareholders and \npotential investors.  \nThe Manager undertakes an annual programme of \nmeetings with the largest shareholders and investors and \nreports back to the Board on issues raised at these \nmeetings. The Investment Manager, who is based in the \nManager’s Tokyo office, will attend such meetings. In \nnormal circumstances, the Board encourage all \nshareholders to attend and participate in the Company’s \nAGM and shareholders can contact the Directors via the \nCompany Secretary. Shareholders and investors can \nobtain up-to-date information on the Company through \nits website and the Manager’s information services and \nhave direct access to the Company through the \nManager’s customer services team or the  \nCompany Secretary. \nAs an investment trust, a number of the Company’s \nfunctions are outsourced to third parties. The key \noutsourced function is the provision of investment \nmanagement services to the Manager and other \nstakeholders support the Company by providing \nsecretarial, administration, depositary, custodial, banking \nand audit services.  \nThe Board undertakes a robust evaluation of the Manager, \nincluding investment performance and responsible \nownership, to ensure that the Company’s objective of \nproviding sustainable income and capital growth for its \ninvestors is met. The Board typically visits the Manager’s \noffices in Tokyo on an annual basis. This enables the Board \nto conduct due diligence of the fund management and \nresearch teams. The Board has not travelled to Japan \nover the last two years whilst government restrictions on \nentry to the country as a result of Covid-19 were in place, \nhowever, a number of virtual meetings were held between \nthe Board and the Manager’s investment team in Tokyo to \nreview portfolio construction and sector analysis.

In view of the \nManager’s style of investing, there can be, in the short-\nterm, considerable divergence from both comparators. \nThe Board uses a three year rolling performance for the \nfollowing KPIs: total NAV return against the benchmark \nindex and share price total return compared with the Peer \nGroup. The KPI for the discount comparison to its Peer \nGroup is over one year.

In the 90 days to 31 March \n2022, the Ordinary shares traded at an average discount \nof 9.4% to the underlying NAV and, as such, a continuation \nvote was not required.  \nBoard Diversity \nThe Board recognises the importance of having a diverse \ngroup of Directors with the appropriate mix of \ncompetencies and expertise to allow the Board to fulfil its \nobligations. At 31 March 2022 there were two male \nDirectors and two female Directors, all of whom bring a \nvariety of knowledge, experience and skills and contribute \ndistinctively to the Board’s performance. Further detail is \nprovided on page 44 (under Nomination Committee). \nEmployee, Environmental, Social & Human \nRights Issues  \nThe Company has no employees as it has delegated \noperational management to the Manager. There are \ntherefore no disclosures to be made in respect of \nemployees. Further information on socially responsible \ninvestment can be found on pages 42 to 45. \nGlobal Greenhouse Gas Emissions and \nStreamlined Energy and Carbon  \nReporting (“SECR”) \nAll of the Company’s activities are outsourced to third \nparties. The Company therefore has no greenhouse gas \nemissions to report from the operations of its business, nor \ndoes it have responsibility for any other emissions \nproducing sources under the Companies Act 2006 \n(Strategic Report and Directors’ Reports) Regulations \n2013.

The Company is therefore not required to make \na slavery and human trafficking statement. In any event, \nthe Board considers the Company’s supply chains, dealing \npredominantly with professional advisers and service \nproviders in the financial services industry, to be low risk in \nrelation to this matter. \nViability Statement \nThe Company’s business model is designed to deliver long \nterm capital growth to its shareholders through \ninvestment in readily realisable stocks in the Japanese \nequity markets.

Third party services have continued to \nbe provided effectively; \n· The liquidity of the Company’s underlying portfolio;  \n· Recent stress testing has confirmed that shares can be \neasily liquidated, despite the more uncertain and volatile \neconomic environment;  \n· The level of forecast revenue surplus generated by the \nCompany and its ability to achieve the dividend policy;  \n· The level of gearing is closely monitored by the Board. \nCovenants are actively monitored and there is \nadequate headroom in place; and \n· The Company has a fixed term loan facility of JPY 1.3 \nbillion in place until January 2023 and a revolving loan \nfacility of JPY 1.0 billion in place until December 2024. \nThe Company has the ability to renew or repay its \ngearing through proceeds from equity sales.  \nAccordingly, taking into account the Company’s current \nposition and its prospects, and the potential impact of its \nprincipal risks and uncertainties, the Directors have a \nreasonable expectation that the Company will be able to \ncontinue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due \nfor a period of three years from the date of this Report.  \nIn making this assessment, the Board has considered that \nmatters such as significant economic or stock market \nvolatility (including the possibility of a greater than \nanticipated economic impact of geopolitical \ndevelopments), a substantial reduction in the liquidity of \nthe portfolio, or changes in investor sentiment could have \nan impact on its assessment of the Company’s prospects \nand viability in the future.  \nThe Strategic Report was approved by the Board of \nDirectors and signed on its behalf for abrdn Japan \nInvestment Trust plc by:  \nKaren Brade, \nChairman \n27 May 2022 \n \nOverview of Strategy \nContinued"

The company later expanded \ninto other business areas including vehicle coatings, \nchemicals and electronics. It has been using the funds \nfrom its highly cash-generative businesses, including glass \nproducts, to invest in structural growth opportunities. \nThese include pharmaceutical development and \nmanufacturing outsourcing, EUV masks blanks (used in the \nsemiconductor industry), and glass and display products \nfor next-generation vehicles. \nIn the Investment Manager’s discussions with AGC’s senior \nmanagement regarding the company’s climate strategy \nand policy on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, it was \nencouraged to learn that AGC undertook a review of its \nclimate footprint via the Taskforce for Climate-related \nFinancial Disclosures (TCFD) framework in 2019. This \nenabled AGC to work through the impact of various \nclimate change scenarios on its business and \nacknowledge the significant risks that it faces. As a result, \nthe company committed to being a net-zero carbon \nbusiness by 2050. \nIn 2021, AGC established an additional, more immediate, \ncarbon reduction milestone. By 2030, it intends to reduce \nits carbon footprint using several methods, including \nupgrading its 30-plus float furnaces which are the main \nsource of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in its glass-\nmaking activities. AGC intends to enhance the production, \nfuel combustion and energy efficiencies of its furnaces, as \nwell as install solar panels. Whilst this was encouraging, the \nInvestment Manager suggested that the company could \nbetter inform investors by disclosing one-year emissions \ntargets, as well as reporting on its annual emissions. \nThe Investment Manager also learned that AGC’s \narchitectural glass helps reduce carbon dioxide emissions \nduring product use by ten times the amount of GHG \nemitted during production of the glass. This is a typical \nissue for manufacturing companies, where so-called \nscope 1 (direct) and scope 2 (indirect) emissions are high, \nbut the manufacturer’s products significantly reduce \nscope 3 emissions (emissions from a company’s value \nchain). The Investment Manager again advised the \ncompany to better inform the market through the \ndisclosure of this information and will monitor the \ncompany’s progress in this regard. \nInvestment Case Studies"

ASFML has been appointed to provide \ninvestment management, risk management, \nadministration and company secretarial services as well \nas promotional activities. The Company’s portfolio is \nmanaged by abrdn Japan Limited (the “Investment \nManager”) by way of a group delegation agreement \nbetween ASFML and abrdn Japan Limited.  \nUnder delegation from ASFML, company secretarial, \naccounting and administrative services are provided by \nAberdeen Asset Management PLC (the “Secretary”). The \nmanagement agreement may be terminated by either \nthe Company or the Manager on the expiry of six months' \nwritten notice.

The Board has reviewed the results of  \nstress testing prepared by the Manager in relation  \nto the ability of the assets to be realised in the current \nmarket environment.  \nThe Company does not have a fixed life. However, under \nthe articles of association, if, in the 90 days preceding the \nCompany’s financial year-end (31 March), the Ordinary \nshares have been trading, on average, at a discount in \nexcess of 10% to the underlying NAV over the same \nperiod, notice will be given of an ordinary resolution to be \nproposed at the following AGM to approve the \ncontinuation of the Company. In the 90 days to 31 March \n2022, the Ordinary shares traded at an average discount \nof 9.4% to the underlying NAV. Accordingly, no resolution \non the continuation of the Company will be put to the \nCompany's shareholders at the AGM."

A replacement option would be sought in \nadvance of the expiry of the facility in January 2023, or, \nshould the Board decide not to renew this facility, any \noutstanding borrowing would be repaid through the \nproceeds of equity sales as required. \nThe Company’s portfolio comprises primarily “Level 1” \nassets (listed on a recognisable exchange and realisable \nwithin a short timescale). The results of stress testing \nprepared by the Manager, which models a sharp decline \nin market levels and income, demonstrated that the \nCompany had the ability to raise sufficient funds so as to \nremain within its debt covenants and pay expenses. \nTaking the above factors into consideration, the Board has \na reasonable expectation that the Company has \nadequate resources to continue in operational existence \nfor a period of at least 12 months from the date of \napproval of these financial statements.

The \nauthorisation is limited to:- \na) the issue of shares otherwise than as described in (b) \nup to an aggregate nominal value of £125,599 \n(equivalent to 10% of the Ordinary shares in issue at \nthe date of this Report); and \nb) the allotment of shares in connection with an offer to \nall holders of Ordinary shares in proportion to their \nholdings in the Company. \nThis authority will last until the conclusion of the Annual \nGeneral Meeting held in 2023 or, if earlier, 30 September \n2023 (unless previously varied, revoked or extended). \nThe Company may hold such shares “in treasury” and \nthen sell them at a later date for cash rather than simply \ncancelling them. Such sales are required to be on a pre-\nemptive, pro rata, basis to existing shareholders, unless \nshareholders agree by special resolution to disapply such \npre-emption rights. Accordingly, in addition to giving the \nDirectors power to allot unissued Ordinary share capital \non a non pre-emptive basis, Resolution 11 will also give the \nDirectors power to sell Ordinary shares held in treasury on \na non pre-emptive basis, subject always in both cases to \nthe limitations noted above.

      "text": "42 \nabrdn Japan Investment Trust plc \nThis Statement of Corporate Governance forms part of \nthe Directors’ Report which is provided on pages 38 to 41. \nIntroduction \nThe Company is committed to high standards of \ncorporate governance. The Board is accountable to the \nCompany’s shareholders for good governance, and this \nstatement describes how the Company applies the \nprinciples identified in the 2018 UK Corporate Governance \nCode (the “UK Code”), which is available on the Financial \nReporting Council’s website: frc.org.uk. The Association of \nInvestment Companies has also published a Code of \nCorporate Governance for Investment Trusts© (“AIC \nCode”), which is available on the AIC’s website: \ntheaic.co.uk. The AIC Code forms a comprehensive guide \nto best practice in certain areas of governance where the \nspecific characteristics of investment trusts suggests \nalternative approaches to those set out in the UK Code \nthat may be preferable. There is a certain amount of \noverlap with the UK Code, although the focus of attention \nis on the points of difference.  \nApplication of the Principles of the Codes \nThe Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority require the \nBoard to report on compliance with the UK Code \nprovisions. In instances where the UK Code and AIC Code \ndiffer, an explanation is given in this Statement of \nCorporate Governance. \nThe Board confirms that, during the year to 31 March \n2022, the Company complied with the recommendations \nof the AIC Code and the relevant provisions of the UK \nCode, except as set out below:  \n1. \nthere was not a Senior Independent Director during \nthe financial year (UK Code Provision 12 and AIC Code \nProvision 37). \n2. \nthe Chairman chairs the Remuneration Committee \n(UK Code Provision 32 and AIC Code Provision 37). \n3. \nthe Chairman is a member of the Audit Committee \n(UK Code Provision 24). \nDue to the small size of the Board, it has not been \nconsidered necessary for there to be a Senior \nIndependent Director during the financial year; and the \nRemuneration Committee is chaired by Karen Brade. In \nline with the AIC Code, Karen Brade is deemed an \nindependent member of the Audit Committee.  \nBoard Structure \nThe Board comprises four Non-Executive Directors, all of \nwhom are considered to be independent of the Manager, \nAberdeen Standard Fund Managers Limited, and free of \nany relationship which could materially interfere with the \nexercise of their independent judgement on issues of \nstrategy, performance, resources and standards of \nconduct.  \nThe Board’s policy on tenure is that Directors need not \nserve on the Board for a limited period of time only and \nthat the independence of Directors is not necessarily \nconstrained by their length of service. The Board does not \nconsider that the length of service of a Director is as \nimportant as the contribution he or she has to make, and \ntherefore the relevance of individual length of service will \nbe determined on a case by case basis, which is \nconsistent with the AIC Code. The Company benefits from \na balance of Board members with different tenures, \ndifferent backgrounds and a wide variety of experience \nwhich the Directors believe adds significantly to the \nBoard’s strength. There is no age limit for Directors in the \narticles of association.  \nThe Board is mindful of the importance of having an \norderly succession plan and actively evaluates Directors’ \nperformance annually to an appropriate balance of up to \ndate skills and capacity. As part of an agreed succession \nplan, Karen Brade will retire as Chairman of the Company \nat the AGM in 2023. Sir David Warren has agreed to be \nappointed the Senior Independent Director, with effect \nfrom 27 May 2022. \nRole and Operation of the Board \nThe Board sets the Company’s values and objectives and \nensures that its obligations to its shareholders are met. It \nhas formally adopted a schedule of matters which are \nrequired to be brought to it for decision, thus ensuring that \nit maintains full and effective control over appropriate \nstrategic, financial, operational and compliance issues. \nThis includes: \n· maintenance of clear investment objectives and risk \nmanagement policies; \n· monitoring of the business activities of the Company \nranging from analysis of investment performance \nthrough to annual budgeting and quarterly forecasting \nand variance analysis; \n· setting the range of gearing and hedging within which \nthe Manager may operate; \n· major changes relating to the Company’s structure, \nincluding share buy-backs and share issuance; \n· Board appointments and removals and the  \nrelated terms; \nStatement of Corporate Governance"

The Committee \nundertakes a detailed annual review of the performance \nof the Manager and the terms of the management \nagreement.   \nAs a result of these reviews, the Board concluded that the \nManager has satisfactorily met the terms of the \nmanagement agreement with the Company, and \nconsiders that the continuing appointment of the \nManager is in the interests of the Company and its \nshareholders. The key factors taken into account in \nreaching this decision were the commitment, investment \nskills and experience of the Manager’s personnel and the \nlong term record of their performance in managing \nequities in Japan. \nRemuneration Committee \nThe Remuneration Committee is chaired by Karen Brade \nand comprises all Directors of the Company due to the \nsmall size of the Board.  \nRemuneration has been set in order to attract individuals \nof a calibre appropriate to the future development of the \nCompany. The Company’s policy, together with details of \nthe remuneration of each Director, is detailed in the \nDirectors’ Remuneration Report. \nNomination Committee \nThe Nomination Committee is chaired by Karen Brade \nand comprises all Directors of the Company. The \nCommittee’s duties include annual appraisals, succession \nplanning, new appointments and training. New \nappointments are made on merit, taking into account the \nbenefits of diversity. The Board’s overriding priority is to  \nappoint the most appropriate candidate and it has not set \nany measurable targets in relation to the diversity of the \nBoard. The Committee reviews the composition, \nexperience and commitment of the Directors.  \nNew Directors are given appropriate induction from the \nManager covering the Manager’s operations, legal \nresponsibilities and industry matters. Directors are \nprovided with appropriate training on changes in \nregulatory requirements, relevant industry issues  \nand developments and are able to participate in \ntraining courses run by the AIC and other financial  \nservices providers. \nThe Committee has undertaken an annual performance \nevaluation, using questionnaires and discussion, to ensure \nthat the Directors have all devoted sufficient time and \ncontributed adequately to the work of the Board and \nCommittees and to consider each Director’s \nindependence and other commitments. The outcome of \nthis evaluation was satisfactory in each case and each \nDirector is committed to serve the Company effectively.  \nThe Committee considers that the Board’s current \nsignificant diversity of skills, experience and culture serve \nthe Company well and should be a consideration in \nselecting a new Director.   \nAll Directors of the Company will stand for re-election on \nan annual basis in line with the provisions of the UK Code.  \nThe Chairman’s performance appraisal is led by the \nSenior Independent Director. The Directors are \nunanimously of the opinion that Karen Brade, who was \nindependent on appointment, remains independent of the \nManager in character and judgment.

The \nChairman facilitates the effective contribution of, and \nencourages active engagement by, each Director. In \nconjunction with the Company Secretary, the Chairman \nensures that Directors receive accurate, timely and clear \ninformation to assist them with effective decision-making. \nThe Chairman acts upon the results of the Board \nevaluation process by recognising strengths and \naddressing any weaknesses and also ensures that the \nBoard engages with major shareholders and that all \nDirectors understand shareholder views. \nThe role of the Senior Independent Director is to act as a \nsounding board for the Chairman and as an intermediary \nfor other directors, when necessary. Working closely with \nthe Nomination Committee, the Senior Independent \nDirector takes responsibility for an orderly succession \nprocess for the Chairman, and leads the annual appraisal \nof the Chairman’s performance. The Senior Independent \nDirector is also available to shareholders to discuss any \nconcerns they may have. \nCommunication with Shareholders \nThe Company places a great deal of importance on \ncommunication with its shareholders. The Manager has \nan annual programme of meetings with institutional \nshareholders and reports back to the Board on them. \nWhen shares in the Company are held in the name of \nnominee companies and notification has been received in \nadvance, nominee companies will be provided with copies \nof shareholder communications for distribution to their \ncustomers. Nominee investors may attend and speak at \ngeneral meetings. \nParticipants in the Manager’s Savings Scheme are given \nthe opportunity to vote by means of a Letter of Direction \nenclosed with the Annual Report. The Letter of Direction is \nforwarded to the administrator of the Savings Scheme, \nwho will complete a proxy on behalf of the participants \nand forward it to the Company’s registrars for inclusion in \nthe voting figures.  \nAs recommended best practice under the UK Code, the \nAnnual Report is normally posted to shareholders at least \n20 business days before the AGM. The Notice of Meeting \nsets out the business of the meeting and the resolutions \nare explained more fully in the Directors’ Report. Separate \nresolutions are proposed for each substantive issue. \nThe Board encourages shareholders to attend and \nparticipate at the Company’s AGM. The Investment \nManager usually provides a presentation at the meeting \noutlining the key investment issues that affect the \nCompany and all shareholders have the opportunity to \nraise questions.

All \nnon-audit services must be approved in advance by  \nthe Committee. \n  \nThe Committee undertakes an annual performance \nevaluation, in relation to discharging its responsibilities, \nthrough questionnaires and discussion.  \nThe respective responsibilities of the Directors and the \nexternal auditor in connection with the financial \nstatements appear on pages 52 and 59. \nActivities during the Year \nThe Committee meets at least twice per year when it \nreviews the annual and half yearly financial reports in \ndetail. Reports from the Manager’s internal audit, risk and \ncompliance departments are also considered by the \nCommittee which cover internal control systems, risk and \nthe conduct of the business in the context of its regulatory \nenvironment. The Committee also receives reports \ndirectly from the independent depositary on the \neffectiveness of its operations and internal controls. \nSignificant Accounting Issue \nThe significant accounting issue considered by the \nCommittee, including those communicated by the \nexternal auditor, in relation to the Company’s financial \nstatements for the year to 31 March 2022 was the \nvaluation, existence and ownership of investments. The \nvaluation of investments is undertaken in accordance with \nthe stated accounting policies.

Investment income is \naccounted for in accordance with stated accounting \npolicies and regularly reviewed by the Committee. The \nBoard regularly reviews the Company’s income and \nrevenue forecasts.  \n· Compliance with investment trust status, under section \n1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 which is \nmonitored by the Manager on an ongoing basis and \nreported to the Committee. \nReview of Auditor \nThe Committee has reviewed the independence  \nand the effectiveness of the auditor, KPMG LLP (“KPMG”), \nas follows: \n· The auditor reports on an annual basis the steps it takes \nto ensure its independence and objectivity and confirms \nthat it has complied with the relevant UK independence \nguidelines. The level of non-audit services provided by \nthe auditor is assessed and for the year ended 31 March \n2022 there were no non-audit services provided. \n· The Committee considers the experience, continuity \nand tenure of the audit team, including the senior \nstatutory auditor. The audit team consists of suitably \nexperienced staff with knowledge of the investment \ntrust sector and there is a process in place for the \nrotation of the audit director. \n· The Committee assesses the level of audit service \nannually. The audit plan is reviewed well in advance and \nsubsequent audit findings are reported \ncomprehensively in a timely manner and are resolved \nsatisfactorily. The auditor has a good working \nrelationship with both the Board and the Manager. \nFollowing a review, the Committee is satisfied that KPMG \nremains independent and effective and supports the  \nre-appointment of KPMG LLP as auditor for approval at \nthe AGM.  \nAudit Tenure \nUnder EU legislation listed companies are required to \ntender the external audit at least every ten years, and \nchange auditor at least every twenty years. The \nCommittee last undertook an audit tender process in 2015 \nwhen KPMG LLP was appointed as auditor in respect of \nthe financial year ended 31 March 2016. Under EU \nlegislation, the Company will be required to tender the \nexternal audit no later than for the year ending 31 March \n2026. In accordance with professional and regulatory \nstandards, the audit director responsible for the audit is \nrotated at least every five years in order to protect \nindependence and objectivity and to provide fresh \nchallenge to the business. The senior statutory auditor, \nGary Fensom, has served four years (including the year to \n31 March 2022).   \nInternal Control \nThe Board is ultimately responsible for the Company’s \nsystem of internal control and for reviewing its \neffectiveness. The Audit Committee confirms that as at 31 \nMarch 2022 there was a robust process for identifying, \nevaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the \nCompany. This process has been in place for the year \nunder review and up to the date of approval of this annual \nreport and financial statements, and is regularly reviewed \nby the Board and accords with the Financial Reporting \nCouncil’s Guidance on Internal Controls.  \nUnder the Management Agreement, the management of \nthe Company’s assets has been delegated to the \nManager within overall guidelines. Risks are identified and \ndocumented through a risk management framework by \neach function within the Manager’s activities. The internal \ncontrol systems operated by the Manager are monitored \nand supported by internal audit and compliance function \nwhich undertakes periodic examination of business \nprocesses, including compliance with the terms of the \nmanagement agreement, and ensures that \nrecommendations to improve controls are implemented. \nThe Committee has reviewed the effectiveness of the \nManager’s system of internal control, in particular the \nprocess for identifying and evaluating the significant risks \naffecting the Company, including financial, operational, \nregulatory and compliance, and the policies by which \nthese risks are managed."

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is a sufficient and \nappropriate basis for our opinion. Our audit opinion is consistent with our report to the audit committee.  \nWe were first appointed as auditor by the shareholders on 14 July 2015. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is \nfor the seven financial years ended 31 March 2022.

We summarise below the key audit matter \n(unchanged from 2021), in arriving at our audit opinion above, together with our key audit procedures to address this \nmatter and, as required for public interest entities, our results from those procedures. This matter was addressed, and \nour results are based on procedures undertaken, in the context of, and solely for the purpose of, our audit of the financial \nstatements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and consequently are incidental to that opinion, and we do \nnot provide a separate opinion on this matter. \n \nThe risk \nOur response \nCarrying amount of \nquoted investments \n(£99.5m; 2021: \n£117.7m) \nRefer to page 46 \n(Audit Committee \nReport), pages 66 to \n68 (accounting \npolicy) and pages \n72 and 80 (financial \ndisclosures). \nLow risk, high value \nThe Company’s portfolio of level 1 quoted \ninvestments makes up 99% (2021: 98%) of the \nCompany’s total assets (by value) and is \nconsidered to be the key driver of results.  \nWe do not consider these investments to be at \na high risk of significant misstatement, or to be \nsubject to a significant level of judgement \nbecause they comprise liquid, quoted \ninvestments.  \nHowever, due to their materiality in the context \nof the financial statements as a whole, they are \nconsidered to be the area which had the \ngreatest effect on our overall audit strategy \nand allocation of resources in planning and \ncompleting our audit. \nWe performed the detailed tests below rather than \nseeking to rely on the Company’s controls, because the \nnature of the balance is such that we would expect to \nobtain audit evidence primarily through the detailed \nprocedures below. \nOur procedures included:  \n· Tests of detail: Agreeing the valuation of 100% of level 1 \nquoted investments in the portfolio to externally quoted \nprices; and \n· Enquiry of Depositary: Agreeing 100% of level 1 \ninvestment holdings in the portfolio to independently \nreceived third party confirmations from the investment \ndepositary. \nOur results: We found the carrying amount of quoted \ninvestments to be acceptable (2021: acceptable). \nIndependent Auditor’s Report for  \nabrdn Japan Investment Trust plc"

We applied this percentage in our determination of performance materiality because \nwe did not identify any factors indicating an elevated level of risk. \nWe agreed to report to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £50k \n(2021: £59k), in addition to other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. \nOur audit of the Company was undertaken to the materiality level specified above and was performed by a  \nsingle audit team. \nThe Scope of the audit work performed was fully substantive as we did not rely upon the Company’s internal control over \nfinancial reporting. \n4 Going Concern  \nThe Directors have prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis as they do not intend to liquidate the \nCompany or to cease its operations, and as they have concluded that the Company’s financial position means that this is \nrealistic. They have also concluded that there are no material uncertainties that could have cast significant doubt over its \nability to continue as a going concern for at least a year from the date of approval of the financial statements (“the going \nconcern period”).  \nWe used our knowledge of the Company, its industry, and the general economic environment to identify the inherent \nrisks to its business model and analysed how those risks might affect the Company’s financial resources or ability to \ncontinue operations over the going concern period. The risks that we considered most likely to adversely affect the \nCompany’s available financial resources and its ability to operate over this period were: \n· The impact of a significant reduction in the valuation of investments and the implications for the Company’s  \ndebt covenants;  \n· The liquidity of the investment portfolio and its ability to meet the liabilities of the Company as and when they  \nfall due; and \n· The operational resilience of key service organisations. \nWe considered whether these risks could plausibly affect the liquidity in the going concern period by assessing the \ndegree of downside assumption that, individually and collectively, could result in a liquidity issue, taking into account the \nCompany’s current and projected cash and liquid investment position. \nWe considered whether the going concern disclosure in note 2 to the financial statements gives a full and accurate \ndescription of the Directors’ assessment of going concern, including the identified risks and related sensitivities.  \nIndependent Auditor’s Report for  \nabrdn Japan Investment Trust plc \nContinued"

      "text": "abrdn Japan Investment Trust plc \n55 \nOur conclusions based on this work: \n· we consider that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial \nstatements is appropriate; \n· we have not identified, and concur with the Directors’ assessment that there is not, a material uncertainty related to \nevents or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as \na going concern for the going concern period; \n· we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the Directors’ statement in Note 2 (a) to the financial \nstatements on the use of the going concern basis of accounting with no material uncertainties that may cast \nsignificant doubt over the Company’s use of that basis for the going concern period, and we found the going concern \ndisclosure in note 2 (a) to be acceptable; and \n· the related statement under the Listing Rules set out on page 39 is materially consistent with the financial statements \nand our audit knowledge. \nHowever, as we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are \ninconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the above conclusions are not a \nguarantee that the Company will continue in operation.  \n5 Fraud and breaches of laws and regulations – ability to detect \nTo identify risks of material misstatement due to fraud (“fraud risks”) we assessed events or conditions that could \nindicate an incentive or pressure to commit fraud or provide an opportunity to commit fraud. Our risk assessment \nprocedures included: \n· Enquiring of Directors as to the Company’s high-level policies and procedures to prevent and detect fraud, as well as \nwhether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud;  \n· Assessing the segregation of duties in place between the Directors, the Administrator and the Company’s Investment \nManager; and \n· Reading Board and Audit Committee minutes. \nAs required by auditing standards, we perform procedures to address the risk of management override of controls, in \nparticular to the risk that management may be in a position to make inappropriate accounting entries. We evaluated the \ndesign and implementation of the controls over journal entries and other adjustments and made inquiries of the \nAdministrator about inappropriate or unusual activity relating to the processing of journal entries and other adjustments. \nWe identified no material post-closing entries and, based on the results of our risk assessment procedures and \nunderstanding of the process, including the segregation of duties between the Directors and the Administrator, no high-\nrisk journal entries or other adjustments were identified. \nOn this audit we do not believe there is a fraud risk related to revenue recognition because the revenue is non-\njudgemental and straightforward, with limited opportunity for manipulation. We did not identify any significant unusual \ntransactions or additional fraud risks. \nIdentifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to non-compliance with laws and regulations \nWe identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the financial \nstatements from our general commercial and sector experience and through discussion with the Directors, the \nInvestment Manager and the Administrator (as required by auditing standards) and discussed with the Directors the \npolicies and procedures regarding compliance with laws and regulations. As the Company is regulated, our assessment \nof risks involved gaining an understanding of the control environment including the entity’s procedures for complying \nwith regulatory requirements."

      "text": "56 \nabrdn Japan Investment Trust plc \nThe potential effect of these laws and regulations on the financial statements varies considerably. \nFirstly, the Company is subject to laws and regulations that directly affect the financial statements including financial \nreporting legislation (including related companies legislation), distributable profits legislation, and its qualification as an \nInvestment Trust under UK taxation legislation, any breach of which could lead to the Company losing various \ndeductions and exemptions from UK corporation tax, and we assessed the extent of compliance with these laws and \nregulations as part of our procedures on the related financial statement items.  \nWe assessed the legality of the distributions made by the Company in the period based on comparing the dividends \npaid to the distributable reserves prior to each distribution, including consideration of interim accounts filed  \nduring the year. \nSecondly, the Company is subject to many other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance \ncould have a material effect on amounts or disclosures in the financial statements, for instance through the imposition of \nfines or litigation. We identified the following areas as those most likely to have such an effect: money laundering, data \nprotection, bribery and corruption legislation and certain aspects of company legislation recognising the financial and \nregulated nature of the Company’s activities and its legal form. Auditing standards limit the required audit procedures to \nidentify non-compliance with these laws and regulations to enquiry of the Directors and the Administrator and \ninspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any. Therefore if a breach of operational regulations is not \ndisclosed to us or evident from relevant correspondence, an audit will not detect that breach.  \nContext of the ability of the audit to detect fraud or breaches of law or regulation \nOwing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have detected some material \nmisstatements in the financial statements, even though we have properly planned and performed our audit in \naccordance with auditing standards. For example, the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is \nfrom the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely the inherently limited procedures \nrequired by auditing standards would identify it.  \nIn addition, as with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detection of fraud, as these may involve collusion, \nforgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. Our audit procedures are designed \nto detect material misstatement. We are not responsible for preventing non-compliance or fraud and cannot be \nexpected to detect non-compliance with all laws and regulations. \n6 We have nothing to report on the other information in the Annual Report \nThe Directors are responsible for the other information presented in the Annual Report together with the financial \nstatements. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not \nexpress an audit opinion or, except as explicitly stated below, any form of assurance conclusion thereon.  \nOur responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether, based on our financial statements \naudit work, the information therein is materially misstated or inconsistent with the financial statements or our audit \nknowledge.

The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial \nReporting Standard 102 and with the Statement of Recommended Practice ‘Financial Statements of Investment Trust \nCompanies and Venture Capital Trusts’ (“SORP”) issued by the Association of Investment Companies (“AIC”) in April 2021. \nThey have also been prepared on the assumption that approval as an investment trust will continue to be granted. \n \n \nThe Company’s assets consist mainly of equity shares in companies listed on a recognised stock exchange and in most \ncircumstances, including in the current market environment, are considered to be realisable within a short timescale. The \nBoard has reviewed the results of stress testing prepared by the Manager in relation to the ability of the assets to be \nrealised in the current market environment.  \n \n \nThe Company does not have a fixed life. However, under the Articles of Association, if, in the 90 days preceding the \nCompany’s financial year-end (31 March), the Ordinary shares have been trading, on average, at a discount in excess of \n10% to the underlying NAV over the same period, notice will be given of an ordinary resolution to be proposed at the \nfollowing AGM to approve the continuation of the Company. In the 90 days to 31 March 2022, the Ordinary shares traded \nat an average discount of 9.4% to the underlying NAV and therefore there is no requirement to convene a general \nmeeting of the Company. The earliest date that the Company may be subject to a further continuation vote would be at \na general meeting of the Company which would be likely to be held in mid-2023 following the next review of the discount \ncontrol mechanism within the Articles. \n \n \nThe Company has a fixed term loan facility of JPY 1.3 billion maturing on 20 January 2023.  In addition, the Company has \na three year revolving credit facility of JPY 1.0 billion which expires on 21 December 2024.  The Board has set limits for \nborrowing and regularly reviews the Company’s gearing levels and its compliance with bank covenants. A replacement \noption would be sought in advance of the expiry of the facility in January 2023, or, should the Board decide not to renew \nthis facility, any outstanding borrowing may be repaid through the proceeds of equity sales as required. \n \n \nThe Board has considered the ongoing impact of COVID-19 and recent geopolitical developments and believes that \nthere will be a limited resulting impact on the Company’s operational resources and existence. The results of stress \ntesting prepared by the Manager, which models a sharp decline in market levels and income, demonstrated that the \nCompany had the ability to raise sufficient funds so as to remain within its debt covenants and pay expenses. \n \n \nTaking the above factors into consideration, the Board has a reasonable expectation that the Company has  \nadequate resources to continue in operational existence for a period of at least 12 months from the date of  \napproval of these financial statements. Accordingly, the Board continues to adopt the going concern basis  \nin preparing the financial statements.   \n \n \nThe Company’s financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is also the functional currency as it is the basis upon \nwhich shareholders operate and expenses are generally paid. All values are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds \n(£’000) except when otherwise indicated. \n \n \nThe accounting policies applied are unchanged from the prior year and have been applied consistently. \nNotes to the Financial Statements \nFor the year ended 31 March 2022"

      "text": "abrdn Japan Investment Trust plc \n67 \n \n(b) \nValuation of investments. The Company’s business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total \nreturn in the form of income and capital growth. This portfolio of financial assets is managed and its performance \nevaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy, and information about the \nportfolio is provided internally on that basis to the Company’s Board of Directors. Accordingly, upon initial recognition the \nCompany designates the investments ‘at fair value through profit or loss’. Fair value is taken to be the investment’s cost at \nthe trade date (excluding expenses incidental to the acquisition which are written off in the Statement of \nComprehensive Income, and allocated to ‘capital’ at the time of acquisition). \n \n \nSubsequent to initial recognition, investments continue to be designated at fair value through profit or loss, which is \ndeemed to be bid prices, where the bid price is available, or otherwise at fair value based on published price quotations. \n \n(c) \nIncome. Dividends, including taxes deducted at source, are included in revenue by reference to the date on which the \ninvestment is quoted ex-dividend. Special dividends are reviewed on a case-by-case basis and may be credited to \ncapital, if circumstances dictate. Dividends receivable on equity shares where no ex-dividend date is quoted are brought \ninto account when the Company’s right to receive payment is established. Where the Company has elected to receive \nits dividends in the form of additional shares rather than cash, the amount of the cash dividend is recognised as income. \nAny excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend is recognised in capital reserves. \nInterest receivable on bank balances is dealt with on an accruals basis. \n \n \nWhere applicable the dividend income is disclosed net of irrecoverable taxes deducted at source.  \n \n(d) \nExpenses. All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis. Expenses are allocated to revenue in the Statement of \nComprehensive Income except as follows: \n \n \n– expenses are allocated and borne by capital where a connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value \nof the investments can be demonstrated. In this respect, the investment management fee is allocated 40% to revenue \nand 60% to realised capital reserves to reflect the Company’s investment policy and prospective income and capital \ngrowth; and \n \n \n– transactions costs are charged to capital. \n \n \n(e) \nTaxation. The tax payable is based on the taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in \nthe  Statement of Comprehensive Income because it excludes items of income or expenditure that are taxable or \ndeductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible (see note 7 for a more \ndetailed explanation). The Company has no liability for current tax. \n \n \nDeferred taxation. Deferred taxation is provided on all timing differences, that have originated but not reversed at the \nStatement of Financial Position date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more or a right to \npay less tax in future have occurred at the Statement of Financial Position date, measured on an undiscounted basis and \nbased on tax rates expected to apply in the period that the timing differences reverse. This is subject to deferred tax \nassets only being recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future \nreversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted. Timing differences are differences arising between the \nCompany’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the accounts which are capable of reversal in one or more \nsubsequent periods. Due to the Company’s status as an investment trust company, and the intention to continue to meet \nthe conditions required to maintain approval for the foreseeable future, the Company has not provided deferred tax on \nany capital gains and losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments. \n \n(f) \nNature and purpose of reserves \n \n \nCalled-up share capital. The Ordinary share capital on the Statement of Financial Position relates to the number of shares \nin issue and in treasury. Only when the shares are cancelled, either from treasury or directly, is a transfer made to the \ncapital redemption reserve. This reserve is not distributable."

The \nCompany’s investments and borrowings are made in Japanese yen, however the Board considers the Company’s \nfunctional currency to be Sterling.

The Company’s investment activities expose it to various types of financial risk associated with the financial \ninstruments and markets in which it invests. The Company’s financial instruments comprise securities and other investments, \ncash balances, loans, debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations; for example, in respect of sales and \npurchases awaiting settlement, and debtors for accrued income. \n \nCertain risk management functions have been delegated to Aberdeen Standard Fund Managers Limited (“ASFML” or \n“Manager”) under the terms of the management agreement (further details of which are included under notes 4 and 5). The \nBoard regularly reviews and agrees policies for managing each type of risk, as summarised below. This approach has been \napplied throughout the year within the Manager’s risk management framework which is described below and has not \nchanged since the previous accounting period. \n \nRisk management framework. The directors of ASFML collectively assume responsibility for ASFML’s obligations under the \nAIFMD including reviewing investment performance and monitoring the Company’s risk profile during the year. \n \nASFML is a fully integrated member of the abrdn plc group (“the Group”), which provides a variety of services and support to \nASFML in the conduct of its business activities, including in the oversight of the risk management framework for the Company. \nThe AIFM has delegated the day to day administration of the investment policy to Aberdeen Standard Investments (Japan) \nLimited, which is responsible for ensuring that the Company is managed within the terms of its investment guidelines and the \nlimits set out in its pre-investment disclosures to investors (details of which can be found on the Company’s website). The AIFM \nhas retained responsibility for monitoring and oversight of investment performance, product risk and regulatory and \noperational risk for the Company. \n \nThe Manager conducts its risk oversight function through the operation of the Group’s risk management processes and \nsystems which are embedded within the Group’s operations. The Group’s Risk Division supports management in the \nidentification and mitigation of risks and provides independent monitoring of the business. The Division includes Compliance, \nBusiness Risk, Market Risk and Risk Management. The team is headed up by the Group’s Head of Risk, who reports to the CEO \nof the Group. The Risk Division achieves its objective through embedding the Risk Management Framework throughout the \norganisation using the Group’s operational risk management system (“SHIELD”). \n \nThe Group’s Internal Audit Department is independent of the Risk Division and reports directly to the Audit Committee of the \nGroup’s Board of Directors and to the Group’s CEO. The Internal Audit Department is responsible for providing an independent \nassessment of the Group’s control environment. \n \nThe Group’s corporate governance structure is supported by several committees to assist the Board of Directors of the Group, \nits subsidiaries and the Company to fulfil their roles and responsibilities. The Group’s Risk Division is represented on all \ncommittees, with the exception of those committees that deal with investment recommendations. The specific goals and \nguidelines on the functioning of those committees are described on the committees’ terms of reference. \n \nRisk management. The main risks the Company faces from its financial instruments are (i) market risk (comprising interest rate \nrisk, price risk and currency risk), (ii) liquidity risk and (iii) credit risk. \n \nMarket risk. The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Company may fluctuate because of \nchanges in market prices. This market price risk comprises three elements – interest rate risk, price risk and currency risk. \n \nInterest rate risk. Interest rate movements may affect: \n \n- the level of income receivable on cash deposits; and \n \n- interest payable on the Company’s variable rate borrowings. \n \nNotes to the Financial Statements \nContinued"

The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates \nare taken into account when making investment and borrowing decisions. \n \nInterest rate sensitivity. Movements in interest rates would not significantly affect net assets attributable to the Company’s \nshareholders and total profit due to there being no investments in fixed interest securities during the year and a relatively low \nlevel of bank borrowings. \n \n \nPrice risk. Price risks (ie changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate or currency risk) may affect the \nvalue of quoted investments.       \n \nManagement of the risk. It is the Board’s investment policy for the Company’s assets to be invested in a selected portfolio of \nsecurities in quoted companies as explained on page 14. The Manager has a dedicated investment management process, \nwhich ensures that the risk inherent in this investment policy is controlled. Underlying the process is the belief that risk is not that \nindividual stock prices fluctuate in the short term, or that movement in the value of the portfolio deviates from the benchmark \nbut that risk is investment in poorly managed expensive companies which the Manager does not understand. In-depth \nresearch and stock selection procedures are in place based on this risk control philosophy. The portfolio is reviewed on a \nperiodic basis by the Manager’s Investment Committee and by the Board.       \n \nPrice sensitivity. If market prices at the Statement of Financial Position date had been 10% higher or lower while all other \nvariables remained constant, the return attributable to Ordinary shareholders for the year ended 31 March 2022 would have \nincreased/(decreased) by £9,958,000 (2021 increased/(decreased) by £11,771,000) and equity reserves would have \nincreased/(decreased) by the same amount.        \n \nForeign currency risk. The Company primarily invests in the shares of companies which are listed in Japan but can include \ncompanies listed on other stock markets which earn significant revenue from trading in Japan or hold net assets \npredominantly in Japan. The Statement of Financial Position, therefore, can be significantly affected by movements in foreign \nexchange rates.       \n \nManagement of the risk. The Company may, from time to time, match specific overseas investment with foreign currency \nborrowings. The Company’s borrowings, as detailed in note 12, are also in foreign currency.       \n \nThe revenue account is subject to currency fluctuation arising on dividends paid in foreign currencies. The Company does not \nhedge this currency risk.       \n \nForeign currency risk exposure by currency of denomination:       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 31 March 2022    \n 31 March 2021    \n \n \n \nNet  \nTotal \n \nNet  \nTotal \n \n \nOverseas  \nmonetary  \ncurrency \nOverseas  \nmonetary  \ncurrency \n \n \ninvestments \nassets  \nexposure \ninvestments \nassets  \nexposure \n \n \n£’000 \n£’000 \n£’000 \n£’000 \n£’000 \n£’000 \n \nJapanese Yen \n99,576 \n(9,413)\n90,163 \n117,711 \n(10,051) \n107,660 \n \n \nForeign currency sensitivity. The following table details the positive impact to a 10% decrease in Sterling against the foreign \ncurrency in which the Company has exposure (based on exposure >5% of total exposure including foreign exchange \ncontracts). The sensitivity analysis includes foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the \nyear end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates. In the event of a 10% increase in Sterling then there would be a negative \nimpact on the Company’s returns."

Liquidity risk is not considered to be significant as the Company’s assets mainly comprise readily \nrealisable securities which can be sold to meet funding requirements if necessary and flexibility is achieved through the use of \nloan facilities, details of which may be found in note 12.     \n \nLiquidity risk exposure. At 31 March 2022, the Company had a fixed term bank loan of £8,131,000 (2021 – £8,523,000) which is \ndue to mature on 20 January 2023, with interest due on the principal every six months. The Company had also drawn down \n£2,503,000 (2021 – £2,624,000) which matures on 15 July 2022 with interest payable at each set maturity date, from its \nrevolving credit facility (see note 12 for further details).     \n \n \nCredit risk. This is the risk of failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction that \ncould result in the Company suffering a loss. \n \nManagement of the risk. Investment transactions are carried out with a large number of brokers of good quality credit standing, \nand cash is held only with reputable banks with high quality external credit enhancements. \n \nIn addition, both stock and cash reconciliations to the Depositary’s records are performed on a daily basis to ensure \ndiscrepancies are investigated on a timely basis. \n \nNone of the Company’s financial assets are secured by collateral or other credit enhancements and none are past due  \nor impaired. \n \nCredit risk exposure. The amount of cash at bank and in hand of £264,000 (2021 - £528,000) and debtors of £1,154,000 (2021 - \n£916,000) in the Statement of Financial Position represent the maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 March. \n \nFair values of financial assets and financial liabilities. The fair value of borrowings has been calculated at £10,634,000 as at 31 \nMarch 2022 (2021 - £11,147,000) compared to an accounts value in the financial statements of £10,634,000 (2021 - \n£11,147,000) (note 12), due to the short-term maturity. The fair value of each loan is determined by aggregating the expected \nfuture cash flows for that loan discounted at a rate comprising the borrower’s margin plus an average of market rates \napplicable to loans of a similar period of time and currency. The carrying value of all other assets and liabilities is an \napproximation of fair value. \n \nNotes to the Financial Statements \nContinued"

The Manager believes that superior \ninvestment returns are therefore attainable by identifying \ngood companies cheaply, defined in terms of the \nfundamentals that in our opinion drive share prices over \nthe long term. The Manager undertakes substantial due \ndiligence before initiating any investment including \ncompany visits in order to assure themselves of the quality \nof the prospective investment. The Manager is then \ncareful not to pay too high a price when making the \ninvestment. Subsequent to that investment the Manager \nthen keeps in close touch with the company, aiming to \nmeet management at least twice a year. Given their long-\nterm fundamental investment philosophy, one would not \nexpect much change in the companies in which we invest. \nThe Manager does, however, take opportunities offered to \nthem by what they see as anomalous price movements \nwithin stock markets to either top up or top slice positions, \nwhich accounts for the bulk of the activity within  \nthe portfolio.  \n \n  \nRisk Controls \nThe Manager seeks to minimise risk by in depth research. \nThe Manager does not view divergence from a \nbenchmark as risk – they view investment in poorly run \nexpensive companies that they do not understand as risk. \nIn fact where risk parameters are expressed in \nbenchmark relative terms, asset – including sector – \nallocation constitutes a significant constraint on stock \nselection. Hence diversification of stocks provides their \nmain control.  \nThe Manager’s performance and investment risk unit \nindependently monitors portfolio positions, and reports \nmonthly. As well as attributing performance it also \nproduces statistical analysis, which is used by the \nInvestment Manager primarily to check the portfolio is \nbehaving as expected, not as a predictive tool."

The following pages highlight the way that ESG factors are considered by the Manager. These processes are \nreviewed regularly and liable to change and the latest information is available on the Company’s website.  \nResponsible investing – integration of ESG into the Manager's investment process \n“By embedding ESG factors into our active equity investment process we aim to reduce risk, enhance potential value for \nour investors and foster companies that can contribute positively to the world.” abrdn  \nCore beliefs: Assessing risk, enhancing value \nWhilst the management of the Company’s investments is not undertaken with any specific instructions to exclude \ncertain asset types or classes, the consideration of material ESG factors is a fundamental part of the Manager’s \ninvestment process and has been for over 30 years. It is one of the key dimensions on which the Manager assesses the \ninvestment case for any company in which it invests for three key reasons: \nFinancial returns \nESG factors can be financially material – the level of consideration they are given in a company will \nultimately have an impact on corporate performance, either positively or negatively. Those \ncompanies that take their ESG responsibilities seriously tend to outperform those that do not. \nFuller insight \nSystematically assessing a company’s material ESG risks and opportunities alongside other financial \nmetrics allows the Manager to make better informed investment decisions. \nCorporate advancement \nInformed and constructive engagement helps foster better companies, protecting and enhancing \nthe value of the Company’s investments. \n \n“We believe that the market systematically undervalues the importance of ESG factors. We believe that in-depth ESG \nanalysis is part of both fundamental company research and portfolio construction and will lead to better client \noutcomes” abrdn \nResearching companies: Deeper company insights for better investor outcomes \nThe Manager conducts extensive and high quality fundamental and first-hand research to fully understand the \ninvestment case for every company in its global universe. A key part of the Manager’s research involves focusing its \nextensive resources on analysis of key ESG issues. The Manager’s investment managers, on-desk ESG equity analysts \nand central ESG Investment Team collaborate to generate a deep understanding of the ESG risks and opportunities \nassociated with each company. Stewardship and active engagement with every company are also fundamental to the \ninvestment process helping to produce positive outcomes that lead to better risk-adjusted returns. \nabrdn’s Global ESG Infrastructure \nabrdn has around 150 equity professionals globally. Each systematically analyses ESG risks and opportunities as part of \nthe Manager’s research output for each company. Its central ESG team and on-desk ESG equity analysts support the \ninvestment managers’ first-hand company analysis, producing research into specific themes (e.g. labour relations or \nclimate change), sectors (e.g. forestry) and ESG topics to understand and highlight best practice. Examples of thematic \nand sector research can be found at abrdn.com/en/uk/investor/responsible-investing. \nThe Manager’s ESG Approach"

Working as part of individual regional investment desks – rather than as a separate \ndepartment – these specialists work side by side with investment managers and are integral to pre-\ninvestment due diligence and post-investment ongoing company engagement. They are also \nresponsible for taking thematic research produced by the central ESG Investment Team (see \nbelow), interpreting and translating it into actionable insights and engagement programmes for our \nregional investment strategies.  \nESG Investment Team \nThis central team of more than 20 experienced specialists based in Edinburgh and London provides \nESG consultancy and insight for all asset classes. Taking a global approach both identifies regions, \nindustries and sectors that are most vulnerable to ESG risks and identifies those that can take \nadvantage of the opportunities presented. Working with investment managers, the team is key to the \nManager’s active stewardship approach of using shareholder voting and corporate engagement to \ndrive positive change. \n \nFrom laggards to best in class: rating company ESG credentials \nA systematic and globally-applied approach to evaluating stocks allows the Manager to compare companies \nconsistently on their ESG credentials – both regionally and against their peer group. The Manager captures the findings \nfrom its research and company engagement meetings in formal research notes. Some of the key questions include: \n· Which ESG issues are relevant for this company, how material are they, and how are they being addressed? \n· What is abrdn’s assessment of the quality of this company’s governance, ownership structure and management? \n· Are incentives and key performance indicators aligned with the company’s strategy and the interests of shareholders? \nHaving considered the regional universe and peer group in which the company operates, the Manager’s equity team \nthen allocates it an ESG Quality score (ESG Q Score) between one and five (see below) which will be applied across \nevery stock that the Manager covers globally. \n \n1.

ESG analysis is peer-reviewed within the equities team, \nand ESG factors impacting both sectors and stocks are discussed as part of the formal sector reviews. To be considered \n‘best in class’, the management of ESG factors must be a material part of the company’s core business strategy. It must \nprovide excellent disclosure of data on key risks. It must also have clear policies and strong governance structures, \namong other criteria. \nWorking with companies: Staying engaged, driving change \nOnce abrdn invests in a company, it is committed to helping that company maintain or raise their ESG standards further, \nusing the Manager’s position as a shareholder to press for action as needed. abrdn actively engages with the companies \nin which it invests to help them improve and become even better businesses. \nThe Manager sees this programme of regular engagement as a necessary fulfilment of its duty as a responsible steward \nof clients’ assets. It is also an opportunity to share examples of best practice seen in other companies and to use the \nManager’s influence to effect positive change. The Manager’s engagement is not limited to the company’s \nmanagement team. It can include many other stakeholders such as non-government agencies, industry and regulatory \nbodies, as well as activists and the company’s clients. What gets measured gets managed – so the Manager strongly \nencourages companies to set clear targets or key performance indicators on all material ESG risks where appropriate.  \nThe investment process consists of four interconnected and equally important stages. \nMonitor \nContact \nEngage \nAct \nOngoing due diligence \n· Business performance \n· Company financials \n· Corporate governance \n· Company’s key risks and \nopportunities \nFrequent dialogue \n· Senior executives \n· Board members \n· Heads of departments and \nspecialists \n· Site visits \nExercise rights \n· Attend AGM/EGMs \n· Always vote \n· Explain voting decisions \n· Maximise influence to drive \npositive outcomes \nConsider all options \n· Increase or decrease our \nshareholding \n· Collaborate with other \ninvestors \n· Take legal action if \nnecessary \n \nClimate Change  \nManagers have a duty to consider all factors that may have a financially material impact on returns. Climate change is \nsuch a key factor. The related physical and transition risks are vast and are becoming increasingly financially material for \nmany investments. Not only in the obvious high-emitting sectors, such as energy, utilities and transportation, but also \nalong the supply chain, providers of finance and in those reliant on agricultural outputs and water. \nIn abrdn’s view, companies that successfully manage climate change risks will perform better in the long term. It is \nimportant that the financial implications of material climate-change risks are assessed across all asset classes, including \nreal assets, and make portfolios more resilient to climate risk. \nAdaptation measures are essential to help limit damages from the physical impacts of climate change. This is a \nparticularly important consideration for the real assets in which abrdn invest, such as real estate and infrastructure. \nComparable climate-related data is necessary to enable effective decision making, and is something abrdn actively \nsources and incorporates into its process. abrdn is supportive of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures \n(TCFD) framework to strengthen climate reporting globally. \nRegular engagement with high-emitting investee companies allows abrdn to better understand their exposure and \nmanagement of climate change risks and opportunities. In the actively managed investments, ownership provides \nabrdn with a strong ability to challenge companies where appropriate. abrdn can also influence corporate behaviour \npositively in relation to climate risk management."
