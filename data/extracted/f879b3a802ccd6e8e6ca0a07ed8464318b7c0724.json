The timing \ntherefore \nof \nour \nfirst \npilot \nproduction process could not be \nmore auspicious.  With the \nimminent production testing at \nNomgon and the execution of \nthe MOU with SBEnergy for \nHydrogen in the same region, it \nshould come as no surprise that \nyour company was recognised \nyet again by the Mongolian \nGovernment \nas \n\"The \nBest \nInvestor of 2021\". \n \nThe global energy market and \nthe \npresent \ndomestic \ngas \nshortage in the Australian East \nCoast Market provided just the \nincentive we needed for the \nCompany to acquire its 100% \ninterest in the very prospective \nacreage in Queensland (ATP \n2044) \nclose \nto \nexisting \ninfrastructure.  The troubling \nglobal events of the last 24 \nmonths have made it crystal \nclear that what the democratic \nworld needs is reliable gas \nsourced from politically stable \ncountries like Australia. \n \n \nWith over $20 million in the bank \nat year end, your company can \nafford \nits \nexploration \ncommitments, but you can rest \nassured that your board will \nalways \nlook \nat \nways \nto \ncontinually \nenhance \nshareholder value in a risk-\nappropriate manner. \n \n \nNext year will clearly help to \nfurther \ndefine \nyour \nCompany. \n \nYours sincerely, \n \n \n \nMr Richard Cottee \nNon-Executive Chairman"

      "text": "Page | 4 \nManaging Director’s Report \nOverview \nDuring the 2022 financial year, the world started to emerge from the multiple constraints imposed by \nCOVID-19 and I was pleased to return to Mongolia in late 2021 for the first time since early 2020.  \nHowever, many supply-side constraints still exist, particularly those that require interfacing with \nChina’s ongoing strict border controls.   \nElixir Energy Limited’s (Elixir) team has managed to navigate its way through these shifting sands in \nthe run-up to our (and Mongolia’s) first extended pilot production program.  At the date of writing all \nthe equipment required for the program has made its way from multiple other countries to Mongolia \nand the gas pilot will be put on pump later this calendar year.  \nFor the second year in a row, Mongolia’s Ministry of Mining and Heavy Industry officially recognised \nthe resilience of our ongoing work program despite all the challenges that COVID-19 has thrown up, \nwith the designation of Elixir as “Best Investor of 2021”. \nOur exploration and appraisal program continued through the year.  Across the vast PSC area, \nmultiple wells were drilled, 2D seismic acquired and surface areas mapped.  All activities were \nundertaken safely and environmentally responsibly.   \nOur strong relationships at multiple levels in Mongolia facilitated the rapid development of our Gobi \nH2 green hydrogen project during the year.  This culminated in June with the execution of a MOU \nwith SB Energy Corp, a wholly owned subsidiary of Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp.  Under the MOU \nthe parties are currently working closely together to progress the Gobi H2 project. \nAfter the fiscal year-end, we announced the acquisition of a licence in Queensland – ATP 2044 – \nwhich we consider to be highly prospective and very well located to take advantage of changes to \nthe global and local gas markets following the geopolitically seismic event that was the invasion of \nUkraine in February. \nNomgon PSC - Exploration & Appraisal Program \nIn the fiscal year 2022, the primary focus of the Company’s exploration and appraisal program was \nsetting up Mongolia’s first long-term gas pilot production project.  This has involved importing \nequipment and personnel from a number of countries – all under the challenges posed by COVID-\n19 border and other supply-side restrictions. \nAs of the date of writing, the commencement of the pilot project is now imminent.  Its primary aim is \nsimple – to pump out water and then gas, with a view to establishing a commercial flow rate of the \nlatter.   \nAchieving this would be a game changer for Mongolia – with gas having multiple possible markets in \nareas like power generation, transport fuels, fertiliser production, etc, - all areas in which the country \nis short – with the repercussions of the Ukraine war greatly exacerbating the issue of security of \nsupply and cost of imports. \nOur exploration program in the year targeted multiple sub-basins across the Nomgon PSC, using the \ntools of geological surveys, 2D seismic acquisition and interpretation and of course the drilling of \nmultiple wells.  Like all exploration efforts, not all wells made discoveries, but we were pleased to drill \na good number of wells which encountered coals in the CBM depth window.  Further evaluation work \nwill follow up on these in the months and years to come."

Over the course of the 2022 financial year, we have \nmaterially built upon this initiative – with a very major milestone being passed with the establishment \nof an early-stage partnership with Japan’s SB Energy Corp (SBE).  This was founded through the \nexecution of a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).  SBE is a wholly owned \nsubsidiary of one of Japan’s largest companies – SoftBank Group Corp. \nSBE is the operator of an existing world-class wind farm in the South Gobi and has a similar long-\nterm experience in Mongolia to that of our team – more than a decade.   \nBoth parties have developed a view that Southern Mongolia has the characteristics that could support \ngiga-watt scale green hydrogen production facilities – including very strong renewable energy (wind \nand solar) resources and of course immediate proximity to multiple and large potential markets in \nChina. \nAn important step on the road to a major export facility is a pilot plant that would serve to prove \nviability to multiple stakeholders such as financiers, customers, communities, etc.  Elixir and SBE \naim to build a pathway to a formal joint venture in the course of the 2023 fiscal year to pursue the \ndevelopment of a pilot."

      "text": "Page | 6 \nATP 2044 \nAfter the end of the financial year, we were very pleased to announce the purchase of a 100% interest \nin a large and very well-located permit in Queensland: ATP 2044.  Located only some 35 kilometres \nfrom Australia’s premier gas hub at Wallumbilla, gas from this asset could find markets both \ndomestically and internationally via the connected LNG export plants at Gladstone. \nOur internal estimate of the prospective resources in the permit is very substantial – a mean case in \nexcess of 3 trillion cubic feet of gas – and also 75 million barrels of associated condensate. \nThis permit is located in a deep tight gas play called the Taroom Trough, which was the subject of \nan initial drilling evaluation program by BG Group around a decade ago – a program that delivered \nflows of gas to the surface from multiple wells.  BG’s successor – Shell – still holds an extensive \nposition in the Taroom – as does Australian energy giant Santos.  Elixir plans to build a drilling \nprogram in ATP 2044 that is coordinated as much as possible with the drilling plans of its neighbours. \nLooking Ahead \nElixir has expanded its portfolio to now include three areas – each of which could deliver very strong \nreturns for shareholders. \nOur foundation asset – the Nomgon CBM PSC - will soon host Mongolia’s first extended pilot \nproduction program.  Positive results from this will demonstrate the commerciality of CBM production \nin the country and therefore be a key milestone to ultimate development.  Our exploration program \ncontinues in parallel to de-risk resources in the PSC. \nThe Gobi H2 project is based on two key advantages that Mongolia possesses – world-class \nrenewable resources and a location immediately proximate to the world’s largest energy importing \nnation.  We are currently working very closely with our new partner SB Energy to move forward with \nan initial pilot green hydrogen project – as a demonstration of the multi-gigawatt potential in the \nregion. \nThe acquisition post-financial year end of ATP 2044 in Queensland gives the company an asset that \nis exceptionally well placed to benefit from the global energy market storms that the invasion of \nUkraine has provoked.  Elixir’s Australian team is very familiar with Queensland and our plan is to \ndrill an appraisal well in this tenement in 2023. \n \n \n \nNeil Young \nManaging Director"

The wells were a combination of exploration and appraisal wells.  \nThis brought the total number of well drilled in the PSC since it was executed in 2018, to 33. \n \nFigure 1: Drilling and Seismic Activity in Nomgon IX \nCoal Bed Methane Drilling \nThe Company’s Coal Bed Methane (CBM) wells were drilled with a combination of chip-hole and \ncoring drilling techniques.  The technique to be used is generally at the discretion of the drilling sub-\ncontractor – Elixir generally pays for wells by the metre drilled.  At Elixir’s discretion, cores can be \ntaken to measure for various key CBM parameters such as gas content.  \nOver 12,100m has been drilled, and a total of 330m of coal and a further 155m of silty coal was \nintersected.   \nDuring the fiscal year, three separate Mongolian owned drilling sub-contractors have been used.  \nPost the year end, this has been supplemented with international firm Major Drilling, who has been \nengaged to drill pilot and exploration wells (Figure 2)."

The 2D seismic is fundamental \nin defining the sedimentary depocentres and providing high-resolution stratigraphic information which \nis critical for our well planning.  The 2D seismic was acquired by Microseismic LLC, who is an \nexperienced local Mongolian Seismic Contractor.   \nThe seismic crew was in the field for 128 days between 24 September 2021 and 20 May 2022.  The \ncrew often work throughout the night as there is less wind noise in the evening, improving the quality \nof the data acquired. \nNomgon IX Contingent Resource \nIn the fiscal year ended 30 June 2022, a key focus of Elixir’s program has been setting up a long \nterm pilot production program – whose aim is to flow gas at commercial rates, hence facilitating a \nmaiden reserves booking.  Considerable logistical efforts were undertaken during the year to import \nall the equipment required from multiple countries. \nPost the balance sheet date, the drilling of wells for this pilot commenced and the Company \nanticipates flowing water and gas therefrom later in 2022.   \nThe intended reserve booking builds upon the site specific contingent resources booked during the \nprevious fiscal year ended 30 June 2021, when Elixir announced its first Contingent Resource \nbooking.

The Group holds a \nProduction Sharing Contract in southern Mongolia, which was awarded in late 2018 and covers an \narea of approximately 30,000 square kilometres.  Further details are contained in the Managing \nDirector’s Report provided earlier in the 2022 Annual Report and in the Review of Operations below. \nREVIEW OF OPERATIONS \nOperating Results \nFor the financial year ended 30 June 2022, the Group recorded a net loss from continuing operations \nafter tax of $2 million (2021: loss of $1.5 million).  The current year loss is increased by $0.5 million \ncomparing to the prior year, reflecting a largely unchanged corporate cost structure with all costs \nrelated to the Mongolian CBM project capitalised.  It is noted that the current year loss includes \napproximately $0.5 million (2021: $0.1 million) (net) of non-cash items for share-based remuneration; \nnew ventures $0.34 million; offset by $0.4 million (2021: loss $0.1 million) foreign currency translation \ngain.  The ‘cash loss’ for the year of approximately $1.6 million (2021: $1.3 million) reflects the \nGroup’s operating/administrative costs of approximately $0.137 million per month. \nAt 30 June 2022, the Group held cash of just under $22.7 million (2021: $32.8 million), representing \nfunds raised in the last quarter of the 2021 financial year from a Share placement and Share \nPurchase Plan of $26.6 million ($25.9 million after costs).  During the year, the Group spent \napproximately $8 million (2021: $3.7 million) on the CBM project in Mongolia, described in more \ndetail below. \nOperations Review \nDuring the financial year, the Group’s primary focus was conducting an exploration and appraisal \nprogram in the Nomgon IX CBM PSC.   \nEach year the Company undertakes a regulatory process involving procuring various approvals from \nthe petroleum, environmental and local authorities.  In this financial year this facilitated the acquisition \nof 673 kilometres of 2D seismic and a drilling campaign in the year which comprised both low cost \nstrat-holes and fully tested core-holes.  In total 17 wells were drilled in the financial year. \nDuring the year, Elixir made significant progress with its Gobi H2 green hydrogen project, located in \nthe same part of the South Gobi region as its CBM operations.  This culminated with the execution \nof a non-binding MOU with Japan’s SB Energy Corp to jointly pursue this venture."

At the Company’s Annual General Meeting held on \n23 October 2010, the shareholders of the Company approved that the aggregate amount of Director \nfees payable to Non-Executive Directors of the Company be set at $500,000 per annum in total.  \nFrom September 2021, the Non-Executive Chairman fees are $115,000 per annum (2021: $72,000) \nand Non-Executive Director fees are $70,000 per annum (2021: $45,000).   \nThe Group’s policy is to remunerate Non-Executive Directors at market rates (for comparable \ncompanies) for time, commitment and responsibilities. Cash fees for Non-Executive Directors are not \nlinked to the performance of the Group. However, to align Directors’ interests with shareholders’ \ninterests, Directors are encouraged to hold shares in the Company.  \nRetirement benefits and allowances \nNo retirement benefits or allowances are paid or payable to Directors of the Company (other than \nstatutory or mandatory superannuation contributions, where applicable). \nKey Management Personnel \nBase pay \nKMP receive a competitive level of base pay that comprises the fixed (unrisked) component of their \npay and rewards. Base pay for senior KMP is reviewed annually to ensure market competitiveness. \nThere are no guaranteed base pay increases included in any senior KMP contracts. \nShort-term incentives \nPayment of short-term incentives is at the sole and absolute discretion of the remuneration \ncommittee. The remuneration committee assesses the achievement of key performance milestones \nto determine bonus payments. These milestones require performance in relation to key strategic, \nnon-financial measures linked to drivers of performance in future reporting periods, refer to the \ncurrent and historical performance rights milestones. \nShort-term bonus payments may be adjusted up or down in line with under or over achievement \nrelative to target performance levels at the discretion of the remuneration committee.  During the \nyear, the Managing Director was paid a short-term incentive payment of $120,000 (2021: $75,000) as \ncompensation following successful exploration and other operational results in the prior financial year. \nThere have been no forfeitures of bonuses by KMP during the current or prior periods and no cash \nbonuses remained unvested at year end. \nLong term Incentive - Share-based compensation \nOptions over shares in the Company and Performance Rights may be granted from time to time \nand are required to be approved by shareholders where option over shares or Performance Rights \nare issued to Directors.  The Group’s Employee Incentive Securities Plan (“Plan”) was last \napproved by shareholders at the 2020 Annual General Meeting.  Participation in any incentive \nscheme is at the board’s discretion and no individual has a contractual right to participate in the \nPlan or to receive any guaranteed benefits.  Options or Performance Rights granted under the Plan \ncarry no dividend or voting rights.  The Plan includes rules to prevent participants entering into \ntransactions to remove the “at risk” aspect of the unvested Options or Performance Rights without \nthe approval of the board."

General Information and Basis of Presentation \nElixir Energy Limited (‘Company’) is a for-profit Australian incorporated publicly listed company.   The \nconsolidated financial statements comprise the Company and its controlled entities (‘Group’) and is a \ngeneral-purpose report that has been prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards, \nAustralian Accounting Interpretations, other authoritative pronouncements of the Australian Accounting \nStandards Board and the Corporations Act 2001.  The consolidated financial statements and notes also \ncomply with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting \nStandards Board. \nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of historical cost.  All amounts \nare presented in Australian dollars, unless otherwise noted.   \nThe financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which contemplates the \ncontinuity of normal business activity and the realisation of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the \nnormal course of business.  As outlined below under Impact of COVID-19 pandemic the pandemic has \nnot impacted the Group’s operations in any significant way to date, and it is not expected to have a \nsignificant impact on the Group’s planned exploration activities and operations in Mongolia nor its \nadministrative functions in Mongolia and Australia.  Should the Group’s near-term planned exploration \nactivities be delayed due to COVID-19, the Board expects that its minimum expenditure commitments \nunder the Production Sharing Contract in Mongolia for the 2022 calendar year will be reduced, and a \nforce majeure process under the PSC would facilitate this.  The Board does not believe the pandemic \nwill have any impact on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. \nNew Accounting Standards \nThere are no issued but not yet effective accounting standards or interpretations that are expected to \nsignificantly impact the Group in future financial years. A summary of the Company’s accounting policies \nis contained in Note 26. \nCritical Accounting Judgements and Estimates \nEstimates and judgments are incorporated into the financial statements based on historical knowledge, \nbest available current information and expectations of future events that may have a financial impact on \nthe Group.  Areas that involved a high degree of judgement or complexity and items that are more likely \nto be materially adjusted are shown below: \n(i) \nReview of capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure impairment indicators – Note 7 \n(ii) \nEstimation of fair value of share-based payments – Note 11 \nImpact of COVID-19 pandemic - Judgment has been exercised in considering the impacts that the \nCoronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has had, or may have, on the operations of the Group and its financial \nposition and results. At present it is not expected that the pandemic will have any significant impact on \nthe Group’s planned exploration activities and operations in Mongolia nor its administrative functions in \nMongolia and Australia. \nGroup personnel, key supply chains, and other important stakeholder relationships have remained largely \nunaffected by the pandemic. As at 30 June 2022 and the date of this report, there has been no significant \nimpact upon the financial results and position of the Group reported on in these consolidated financial \nstatements as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Board and management will continue to monitor \nthe impact of the pandemic on the Group’s operations and state of affairs."

The fair value of these securities was determined to be $27,000  based on the \nvalue of the service.   \nRecognition of Share Based Payments: Options and Performance Rights \nThe fair value of options and performance rights is determined at the grant date and then recognised in \nprofit or loss over the vesting period (with the exception of listed options issued to settle certain advisor \nfees related to capital raising, which is accounted for as a reduction in share capital).    \nThe fair value of listed options is determined with reference to the market value of the Company’s listed \noptions on the ASX (EXROA) at the issue date.  The fair value of unlisted options is determined using an \noption pricing model such as the Black-Scholes model, with the key inputs being the current share price \nof the Company, option exercise price, term to expiry, and assumed future share price volatility.  If any of \nthe vesting conditions are ‘market-based’ (such as the achievement of a particular share price), these \nconditions are factored in to the grant date fair value assessment.  The fair value of performance rights is \ndetermined based on the Company’s share price at the grant date.   \nWith respect to Performance Rights, the probability of achieving the relevant performance condition is re-\nassessed at each reporting date and this probability factor is applied to the grant date fair value in \ndetermining the amount to be recognised for the current reporting period.   If and when the relevant \nperformance condition is met and the rights convert to a corresponding number of shares, any remaining \nportion of the grant date fair value that has not previously been recognised is recognised.  \nSignificant accounting estimates and judgments for share-based payments  \nThe determination of the fair value of at grant date of equity-settled Options and Performance Rights \nrequires the use of estimates and judgement.  In particular, the values and amounts recognised as share-\nbased payments expense are particularly sensitive to the share price volatility assumption in valuing \nOptions and the probability assessment of achieving performance conditions with respect to Performance \nRights. \nShare based payments expense for the year consisted of:  \nSecurity \n2022 \n$ \n2021 \n$ \nIncentive Options \n111,425 \n118,258 \nNew Performance Rights \n355,049 \n- \nTotal \n466,474 \n118,258 \nDetail regarding the underlying assumptions used to value and recognise as an expense the Performance \nRights and Options that were issued during the year is shown below. \nPerformance Rights \n• \nNew Performance Rights were issued to a KMPs’ and technical consultants on 28 October 2021 \nwith performance conditions as outlined in Note 12. The grant date was determined to be 28 October \n2021 and the total fair value was determined to be $2,652,000 based on the share price at grant \ndate of $0.26. Total share-based payment recognised during the year was $355,049. The remaining \n$528,951 will be recognised in the twelve months to 30 June 2023. \nThe probability of achieving the milestone set in 2023 is considered likely at 30 June 2022 and \nmilestones set for 2024 and 2025 are considered unlikely at 30 June 2022 and therefore only the \nportion of the grant date fair value related to achieving 2023 milestone is recognised."

The Board monitors \nthe Group’s financial risk management policies and exposures and approves financial transactions within \nthe scope of its authority. It also reviews the effectiveness of internal controls relating to currency risk, \ncommodity price risk, counterparty credit risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk. There have been no \nsubstantive changes in the types of risks the Group is exposed to, how these risks arise, or the Board’s \nobjectives, policies and processes for managing or measuring the risks from the previous period. \n(a) Credit risk \nExposure to credit risk relating to financial assets arises from the potential non-performance by \ncounterparties of contract obligations that could lead to a financial loss to the Group.  Credit risk is managed \nthrough a delegated approval process, establishing and monitoring credit limits, ensuring to the extent \npossible that counterparties to transactions are credit worthy, and monitoring of the financial stability of \nsignificant counterparties.  Credit risk is also minimised by only investing surplus funds in financial \ninstitutions that maintain a high credit rating.  \nThe maximum exposure to credit risk by class of recognised financial assets at the end of the reporting \nperiod, excluding the value of any collateral or other security held, is equivalent to the carrying amount and \nclassification of those financial assets (net of any provisions) as presented in the statement of financial \nposition.

The consideration comprised $3,000,000 of Elixir shares, $500,000 in cash, and \nan over-riding 3% royalty.  \nThere were no other events occurring after year end impacting the operations, results of operations, or \nstate of affairs of the Group requiring disclosure in the 30 June 2022 consolidated financial statements. \n25. \nSummary of Accounting Policies \n(a) \nPrinciples of consolidation \nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets, liabilities and results of entities controlled by \nthe parent entity Elixir Energy Limited at the end of the reporting period. A controlled entity is any entity \nover which the parent has the ability and right to govern the financial and operating policies so as to obtain \nbenefits from the entity’s activities."

A list of controlled entities is \ncontained in Note 19 to the financial statements. \nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, all intragroup balances and transactions between \nentities in the consolidated group have been eliminated in full.  \n(b) \nAsset acquisitions \nWhen an asset acquisition does not constitute a business combination, the assets and liabilities are \nrecorded based on their relative fair values.  No deferred tax balances will arise in relation to the acquired \nassets and assumed liabilities under the initial recognition exemption afforded by AASB 112 Income Taxes.  \nNo goodwill arises on an asset acquisition and transaction costs are included in the fair value of the assets \nand liabilities acquired. \n(c) \nRevenue recognition \nInterest revenue is recognised as the interest accrues using the effective interest method described in \nNote 26(i). \n(d) \nIncome Tax \nIncome tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax expense. \nCurrent income tax expense/benefit is charged to profit or loss representing the tax payable/receivable on \ntaxable income. Current tax liabilities/assets are measured at the amounts expected to be paid \nto/recovered from the relevant taxation authority.  Deferred income tax expense/benefit reflects \nmovements in deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability balances during the year as well the recognition, \nif any, of previously unrecognised tax losses.   \nCurrent and deferred income tax is charged or credited to other comprehensive income/loss when the tax \nrelates to items that are recognised in equity. \nExcept for business combinations, no deferred income tax is recognised from temporary differences \nstemming from the initial recognition of an asset or liability where there is no effect on accounting or taxable \nprofit or loss. \nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period \nwhen the asset is realised or the liability is settled.  Measurement of deferred tax balances reflects the \nmanner in which management expects to recover or settle the carrying amount of the related asset or \nliability.  \nDeferred tax assets relating to temporary differences and unused tax losses are recognised only to the \nextent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the benefits of the deferred \ntax asset can be utilised. \nWhere temporary differences exist in relation to investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates, and \njoint ventures, deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised where the timing of the reversal of the \ntemporary difference can be controlled and it is not probable that the reversal will occur in the foreseeable \nfuture. \nCurrent tax assets and liabilities are offset where a legally enforceable right of set-off exists and it is \nintended that net settlement or simultaneous settlement of the respective asset and liability will occur.  \nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where a legally enforceable right of set-off exists, the deferred \ntax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and it is intended that \nnet settlement or simultaneous settlement will occur in the future.  \nThe Group does not consolidate any Australian entities for tax purposes."

The \nnet amount of GST or VAT recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included with other \nreceivables or payables in the statement of financial position. \n(f) \nProperty, Plant and Equipment \nEach class of property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less, where applicable, any accumulated \ndepreciation and impairment losses. \nThe cost of fixed assets constructed within the consolidated group includes the cost of materials, direct \nlabour, borrowing costs and an appropriate proportion of fixed and variable overheads. \nSubsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as \nappropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the \nGroup and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are recognised \nas expenses in profit or loss during the financial period in which they are incurred. \nIn the event the carrying amount of plant and equipment is greater than the estimated recoverable amount, \nthe carrying amount is written down immediately to the estimated recoverable amount and impairment \nlosses are recognised either in profit or loss.  A formal assessment of recoverable amount is made when \nimpairment indicators are present (refer to Note 28(g)). \nThe cost of property, plant and equipment, excluding freehold land, is depreciated on a straight-line basis \nover the asset's useful life commencing from the time the asset is ready for use.  Leasehold improvements \nare depreciated over the shorter of either the unexpired period of the lease or the estimated useful lives of \nthe improvements.  Assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at \nthe end of each reporting period. \nGains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount and are \nrecognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise. \n(g) \nImpairment of Assets \nAt the end of each reporting period, an assessment is made as to whether there is any indication that an \nasset may be impaired. The assessment will include the consideration of external and internal sources of \ninformation including market conditions and asset-specific matters.  If such an indication exists, an \nimpairment test is carried out on the asset by comparing the asset’s carrying amount to its estimated \nrecoverable amount, being the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Value in use is \ndetermined on the basis of the expected net cash flows that will be received from the asset's employment \nand subsequent disposal discounted to their present values. Where it is not possible to estimate the \nrecoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-\ngenerating unit to which the asset belongs. \nAny excess of the asset’s carrying amount over its recoverable amount is recognised immediately in profit \nor loss. \nImpairment testing is performed annually for goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite lives."

The \nrecoverable amount of the asset (or the cash generating unit (CGU) to which the asset is allocated, being \nno larger than an area of interest) is based on the higher of value in use and fair values less costs to sell. \nIf the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, the asset or cash-generating unit is then written \ndown to its recoverable amount with a corresponding impairment loss recognised in profit or loss. Where \nan impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised \nestimate of its recoverable amount not to exceed the original pre-impairment carrying amount.  \nOnce a decision has been made to proceed with development in a particular area of interest, the relevant \nasset/CGU is tested for impairment, reclassified to development properties and then amortised (once \nproduction commences) over the life of the petroleum reserves associated with the asset or CGU.  \n(i) \nFinancial Instruments \nRecognition and Measurement \nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the entity becomes a party to the contractual \nprovisions to the instrument. For financial assets, this is equivalent to the date that the company commits \nitself to either the purchase or sale of the asset (trade date). \nFinancial assets are classified as those measured at amortised cost, fair value through profit or loss or fair \nvalue through other comprehensive income.  This classification is based on two criteria: the Group’s \nbusiness model for managing the assets; and whether the asset’s contractual cash flows represent ‘solely \npayments of principal and interest’ on the principal amount outstanding.  A financial asset can only be \nmeasured at amortised cost if both these tests are satisfied.  \nTrade and other receivables, and trade and other payables, are classified as amortised cost instruments.  \nThey are initially measured at fair value, which includes transaction costs and any expected credit losses, \nand then subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method.   \nAmortised cost is calculated as the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured at \ninitial recognition, less principal repayments and any reduction for impairment, and adjusted for any \ncumulative amortisation of the difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount calculated \nusing the effective interest method. The effective interest method is used to allocate interest income \n(financial asset) or interest expense (financial liability) over the term of the instrument and is equivalent to \nthe rate that discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts over the expected life of the instrument \nto its to the net carrying amount. Revisions to expected future net cash flows that result in adjustment to \nthe carrying amount, and any gains or losses from derecognition, are recognised in profit or loss.  \nDerecognition occurs in the case of a financial asset where the contractual rights to the receipt of cashflows \nexpire or are transferred to a third party with no significant continuing involvement.   \nFor a financial liability, derecognition occurs when the related obligations are discharged, cancelled or \nhave expired."

Expected credit losses may \narise where there are indications that the counterparty is experiencing significant financial difficulty or might \nenter insolvency proceedings or other financial reorganisation, where there has been a default or \ndelinquency in interest or principal payments, or where changes in economic conditions have occurred \nimpacting on the likelihood of defaults. \nUnder AASB 9 Financial Instruments, a separate allowance account is used to record any expected credit \nlosses on financial assets (including receivables).  For financial assets held at fair value through profit or \nloss, any expected credit losses reduce the carrying amount of the asset directly. \n(j) \nInterests in Joint Operations \nThe Group recognises its direct right to the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses of joint operations \nand its share of any jointly held or incurred assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These have been \nincluded in the appropriate line items of the consolidated financial statements.  \n(k) \nShare Capital and Reserves \nEquity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the fair value of consideration received.  \nIncremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new equity instruments are shown in equity as a \ndeduction from the proceeds.  \nSeparate reserves in shareholders’ equity are utilised to record the consideration received for options \nissued, the fair value of options or performance rights issued for no consideration that has been recognised \nas a share-based payments expense, and for the cumulative foreign exchange translation difference on \ncontrolled entities with a non-Australian dollar functional currency (refer Note 26(n)). \nIf the Company reacquires its own equity instruments, e.g., as the result of share buy-back, those \ninstruments are deducted from equity and the associated shares are cancelled.  No gain or loss is \nrecognised in the profit or loss and the consideration paid including any directly attributable incremental \ncosts is recognised directly in equity. \nIn the case of an in-specie distribution, where an asset of the Group other than cash is distributed to \nshareholders, the share capital of the Group is reduced by the fair value relevant asset. \n(l) \nShare based payments \nThe Group has an Employee Incentive Securities Plan, whereby Shares, Options and Performance Rights \nmay be issued in return for services.  Share based payments to employees are measured at the fair value \nof the instruments issued and recognised in profit or loss as share-based payments expense over the \nrelevant vesting periods.  Share based payments to non-employees are measured at the fair value of \ngoods or services received if they can be reliably measured, otherwise at the fair value of the equity \ninstruments issued. The fair value is recognised when the goods or services are received.  A corresponding \namount to the share-based payments expense or amount recognised for goods or services received is \nrecorded in the share-based payment reserve in equity. \nWhen shares are issued following the exercise of an option, or the vesting of a performance right, a transfer \nis made from the share-based payment reserve to issued capital for the amount related to those particular \noptions or rights.  When an option or performance right expires or lapses, a transfer is made from the \nshare-based payment reserve to retained earnings. \nThe fair value of unlisted options is determined using an option pricing model, such as the Black–Scholes \nmodel.  Performance rights are valued with reference to the Company’s share price at the grant date.  \nMarket-based vesting conditions are factored into the grant date fair value, typically using a probability \nassessment.

Employee benefits that are expected to be settled within one \nyear have been measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liability is settled.  \nEmployee benefits payable later than one year have been measured at the present value of the estimated \nfuture cash outflows to be made for those benefits. In determining the liability, consideration is given to \nemployee wage increases and the probability that the employee may satisfy any vesting requirements. \nThose cash flows are discounted using market yields on corporate bonds with terms to maturity that match \nthe expected timing of cash flows attributable to employee benefits."
